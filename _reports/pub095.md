description: "This report presents an overview of recent research in the preservation of three information carriers: paper, film and photographic materials, and magnetic tape. It covers significant developments internationally over the last five years and concentrates on emerging technologies that have the potential for large-scale application.


The review focuses on work being done in North America, Europe, and Australia. It is intended for those who make decisions about preservation as well as the foundations and other organizations that support such work. Recognizing that this survey cannot convey the full scope or detail of the research noted, the authors have provided contact information for the individuals and institutions mentioned in this survey and a list of references."

description: "The project to translate into Portuguese and disseminate preservation knowledge was part of a broader partnership between the Council on Library and Information Resources, which incorporates the former Commission on Preservation and Access, and a consortium of Brazilian archival, library, and museum institutions. The partnership was intended to serve as an information network for preventative conservation for all Brazilian institutions with collections on paper and film and in digital form. This included federal, state, and municipal institutions; public and private museums; universities; and local cultural institutions and foundations. Following the project's successful first phase in 1998, it received the highest cultural heritage award presented by Brazil's Ministry of Culture. This report gives an overview of the project that discusses the origins, organization and funding, objectives, and results. It then outlines \"The Blueprint Phases One: 1996-1997\" which discusses the documentation in Portuguese, institutional database, core workshops, and regional workshops. \"The Blueprint, Phase Two: 1998-1999\" discusses new workshops, survey, Web site launch, and publications. Lessons learned and recommendations are also outlined. Appendices include the translated titles, institutional database questionnaire, and contact information for collaborative institutions and workgroup members."

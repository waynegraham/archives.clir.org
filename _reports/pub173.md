description: "In September 2015, IMLS awarded CLIR a grant to investigate the early impacts of the National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) programs, in order to inform subsequent development of similar programs by others with a vested interest in building professional capacity to preserve digital information. Keepers of Our Digital Future provides a formative evaluation of the early residencies, based on surveys and interviews with NDSR participants and supervisors from the Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston programs. The authors offer a series of findings and recommendations for future programs, noting that as the model is reproduced, there is a greater need for national-level coordination and communication across programs.

The *Supplementary Assessment of the National Digital Stewardship Residencies, 2016â€“2018*, provides data on the three most recent NDSR initiatives: AAPB NDSR, NDSR Art, and NDSR Foundations to Actions. These programs have placed residents in host institutions across the country, marking a departure form the regionally based programs that were the subject of the original study.

In 2019, NDSR Art commissioned an [independent assessment of the second cohort of its program](https://zenodo.org/record/7805693/files/2019-NDSRArt-ProgramAssessment.pdf?download=1){:target="_blank"}. This formative evaluation focused on gathering qualitative feedback from the 2018-19 cohort of NDSR Art residents, their project supervisors, and the NDSR Art program staff. In addition, an [assessment]() was undertaken to evaluate the curricular aspects of the National Digital Stewardship Residency in Art Information and the values of its changes between program years, and to identify strengths and weaknesses for future application of the NDSR model of cohort-based introductory fieldwork.

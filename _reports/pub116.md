description: "This report provides an overview of selected key national and multinational initiatives in digital preservation occurring outside North America. It examines digital preservation initiatives in four countries-Australia, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom-as well as related multinational initiatives. The initiatives were chosen in consultation with the U.S. Library of Congress (LC) and the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) because they were believed to be of particular relevance and interest to the U.S. National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP).


This study aims to put these initiatives into their national and international context and to outline major developments. It presents the key findings from the survey and details of the main initiatives in each country."

description: "This document presents a framework and resource guide to help cultural heritage institutions plan sustainable access to their digital cultural assets and to do so by means that link their missions to planning modes and models. (In this instance, the term cultural heritage institutions refers to libraries, museums, historical societies, and archives.)


To aid cultural heritage organizations in the business-planning process, this resource will

    * provide a framework to demonstrate the role of business planning in the context of organizational planning
    
    * introduce traditional business-planning elements in the context of their relevance to cultural heritage organizations and their digital asset management programs
    
    * discuss trends in business planning and efforts to sustain programs in digital asset management that are based on survey research
    
    * provide a template to help cultural heritage organizations launch a business-planning process that addresses specific elements contributing to the sustainability of both the digital asset initiative and the overall organization. This template is illustrated with examples drawn from interviews conducted during survey research."

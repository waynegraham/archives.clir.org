description: "This report examines the experiences and contributions of the archival community--practicing archivists, manuscript curators, archival academics, and policy makers who work to define and promote the social utility of records and to identify, preserve, and provide access to documentary heritage regardless of format. The report addresses how the archival science perspective, which brings an evidence-based approach to the management of recorded knowledge, can make a major contribution to a new paradigm for the design, management, preservation, and use of digital resources. It traces the historical development of archival principles and practices and examines, with reference to key research and development projects, how they are currently being transformed into the digital environment to address issues including: information overload; dynamism in documentary forms; pervasive heterogeneity in information resources and media; documentation of relationships within and between resources; resource validation; granularity of description; and exploitation of context and structure in collections of documents. The report concludes with a discussion of what is needed from the archival, library, and other information communities engaged in the development and preservation of digital resources in order to achieve the full potential of cross-community dialog and development."

description: "*Sponsored by the National Recording Preservation Board, Library of Congress. This plan was written by Brenda Nelson-Strauss, Alan Gevinson, and Sam Brylawski, under the direction of Patrick Loughney.*


The National Recording Preservation Plan has been devised to provide a blueprint to “implement a comprehensive national sound recording preservation program,” as mandated in the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000. Congress specified that the program established by the Librarian of Congress under this legislation “shall … increase accessibility of sound recordings for educational purposes.” Preserved recordings can benefit the public only if they are made available for listening. Technological, institutional, and legal impediments to broadened access create daunting challenges for the national preservation effort. This plan identifies the audio field’s most important preservation and access problems and offers recommendations for surmounting them."

description: "This report is an overview of the state of the art for those concerned with the development of digital libraries and the role of library management systems in libraries today. It contrasts librariansâ€™ visions and strategies with the development philosophies of the systems vendors that serve them. Included are profiles of 12 leading library systems vendors as well as case studies of different types of libraries that have installed commercially available systems. The install base served by the vendors in this report is predominantly in the United States."

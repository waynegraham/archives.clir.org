description: "The [Curated Futures Project](https://futures.clir.org/) is a guide for professionals in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums to navigate beyond discussions of decolonizing collecting institutions to begin taking practical steps to enact change.


Organized and edited by CLIR [Postdoctoral Fellows](https://postdoc.clir.org/) and alumni Faithe Day, Synatra Smith, Jodi Reeves Eyre, John MacLachlan, and Christa Williford, the project is the first in a series of collaborations that respond to the theme, “A Third Library is Possible.” The theme draws from the possibilities of the “third university,” a notion developed by la paperson in the book, *[A Third University is Possible](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/a-third-university-is-possible)*.


Contributors to five collaborative projects use a variety of mediums, including podcasts, gaming, and mapping visualizations, to speculate about aligning academic libraries with social impact. The projects include:


* [Geographies of Engaged Digital Scholarship: Remaking Space and Place in the Academic Library](https://futures.clir.org/space-and-place/), by Rachel Starry, Marta Brunner, Matthew Sisk, and Sean Tennant

* [FLAME—Future Libraries, Archives, and Museums in Excavation—a Podcast Series](https://futures.clir.org/flame/), by Jennifer Grayburn, Petrouchka Moïse, Ece Turnator, and Laura Wilson

* [Game-Based Design for Inclusive and Accessible Digital Exhibits](https://futures.clir.org/game-based-design/), by Rebecca Y. Bayeck, Smiti Nathan, and Alex Wermer-Colan

* [Visualizing Scholarship as Social Change](https://futures.clir.org/scholarship-for-social-change/), by Justin Schell

* [The Third Library and the Commons](https://futures.clir.org/the-third-library-the-commons/), by Annie Johnson, Carrie Johnston, and Aditya Ranganath


The Curated Futures Project is the third installment of the CLIR Collaborative Writing Project; previous publications were [The Process of Discovery](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7805460) and [A Splendid Torch](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7805875). Unlike the earlier works, the current project’s authors began their work knowing that in-person engagement would be impossible."

notes:
description: "As digital technology transforms the information landscape, libraries must chart their course in an increasingly fluid, complex environment. How is this new environment redefining leadership in the information professions? What are the personal qualities that produce effective information leaders? CLIR invited three leaders in librarianship to write personally and candidly about what they believe leadership is, how they developed an understanding of their own leadership styles, and how they apply that self-understanding to their daily responsibilities.


Chris Ferguson is dean for information resources at Pacific Lutheran University.


Michael A. Keller is the Ida M. Green University Librarian, director of academic information resources at Stanford University, publisher of HighWire Press, and publisher of Stanford University Press.


Karin Wittenborg is university librarian at the University of Virginia."

description: "This report will be useful to anyone interested in the current state of online American literature resources. Its purpose is twofold: to offer a sampling of the types of digital resources currently available or under development in support of American literature; and to identify the prevailing concerns of specialists in the field as expressed during interviews conducted between July 2004 and May 2005. Part two of the report consolidates the results of these interviews with an exploration of resources currently available. Part three examines six categories of digital work in progress: 

1. quality-controlled subject gateways, 

2. author studies, 

3.  public domain e-book collections and alternative publishing models, 

4.  proprietary reference resources and full-text primary source collections, 

5.  collections by design, and 

6.  teaching applications. This survey is informed by a selective review of the recent literature."

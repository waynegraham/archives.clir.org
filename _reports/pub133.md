description: "The purpose of this study was to determine the legal accessibility of sound recordings published in the United States. The survey was designed to quantify the degree to which rights holders of historical sound recordings have made available, either directly or through licensees, past recordings that they control.


This report is one of several studies that CLIR is undertaking on behalf of the Library of Congress and the National Recording Preservation Board."

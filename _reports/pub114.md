description: "In 2002, with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, CLIR hosted a meeting of scholars, librarians, archivists, technologists, publishers, and funders to discuss the preservation of digital scholarly resources. The goal of the workshop was to identify the needs of various stakeholders-Web site creators; distributors and publishers of digital materials; representatives of archives, libraries, and repositories that want to collect these sites and make them available; end users; and anyone in the chain of scholarly communication who might want to discover and use these works for their own purposes-and to agree on common approaches to meeting those needs.

This report is informed by the lively discussions that took place at that conference, and by two papers that were circulated in advance and which are included as Appendixes. The author describes the scope of problems posed by preserving Web-based scholarly resources. It focuses on “new-model scholarship”-scholarship that is born digital and constitutes an important source for present and future research and teaching. The new-model scholarship is, specifically, the variety of Web sites and other desktop digital objects that faculty and graduate students are creating that fall somewhere short of “published” but are worthy of access into the future."

description: "The National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education (NITLE) was formed in 2001 to “stimulate collaboration between selected liberal arts colleges and to act as a catalyst for the effective integration of emerging and newer digital technologies
into teaching, learning, scholarship, and information management.” In July 2015, NITLE migrated its operations from Southwestern University to CLIR. In conjunction with this migration, CLIR initiated a rigorous analysis of NITLE’s current condition
and the needs of its constituents. CLIR engaged a six-member team of consultants to conduct the assessment.

Drawing on a review of NITLE’s history, and interviews and surveys of past and current stakeholders, the assessment team identifies ways to build thoughtfully on NITLE’s legacy to support the use of digital technologies in liberal education."

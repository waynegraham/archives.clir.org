description: "In 2002, CLIR commissioned a survey of North American-based digital cultural heritage initiatives (DCHIs). The purpose of the survey was to identify the scope, financing, organizational structure, and sustainability of DCHIs. To gain a funderâ€™s perspective on these initiatives, the survey also included a few public and private funding organizations that support projects with a digital cultural heritage component. The survey was a preliminary step in a larger effort aimed at developing recommendations for a coordinated strategy to sustain and strengthen digital cultural heritage initiatives and their by-products.


Survey results and recommendations are in this report."

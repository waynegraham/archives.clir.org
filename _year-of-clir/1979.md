In **1979**, CLR awards a grant of $23,000 to the National Library of Canada (now Library and Archives Canada) to enable it to publish, in computer output microfiche, bibliographic records produced in the CONSER (Conservation of Serials) project. CONSER was a cooperative file-building effort initiated in 1974 to develop a shared database of serials records.

By 1979, OCLC had assumed the management role. _Photo courtesy Library and Archives Canada_. [Read more](https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/1979-23rd-Annual-Report.pdf).

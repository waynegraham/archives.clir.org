In **1978**, CLR brings its decade-long College Library Program to a close. CLR had initiated the program to support libraries seeking to take a more active, meaningful role in undergraduate education. In partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities, CLR established a fund, initially investing $250,000, from which matching grants could be made to individual colleges and universities for activities to provide cohesive links between library services and classroom instruction related to the humanities or areas of the social sciences that use humanistic methods. The program awarded grants to 35 college and university libraries in 25 states. North Carolina Central University (NCCU), pictured here, was among six HBCU recipients. _(Statue of NCCU founder James E.

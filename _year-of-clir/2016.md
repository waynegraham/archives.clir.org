 In July **2015,** CLIR agrees to serve as administrative and staff home for the [International Image Interoperability Framework Consortium](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/){:target="_blank"} (IIIF-C), which had been formed the previous month to provide steering and sustainability for the IIIF community. Created to standardize and improve sharing and display of image-based scholarly resources on the web, [IIIF](https://iiif.io/about/){:target="_blank"} is driven by a community of research, national, and state libraries, museums, companies, and image repositories committed to providing access to high-quality image and audio/visual resources. Initial founding members of the consortium are the British Library, Oxford University, Stanford University, Bayerisches Staatsbibliothek (Bavarian State Library), Biblioth√®que nationale de France (National Library of France), Cornell University, Nasjonalbibliotek (National Library of Norway), Princeton University, Wellcome Trust, and Yale University. Today, the consortium has 57 full and associate members across the globe and continues to grow.

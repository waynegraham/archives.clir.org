In springÂ **2017,** CLIR [receives funds](https://www.clir.org/2017/05/clir-receives-whiting-foundation-grant-prototype-digital-library-middle-east/){:target="_blank"} from The Whiting Foundation to design, implement, and launch a proof of concept for a Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME), envisioned as an interoperable, large-scale digital library of cultural artifacts from the Middle East and North Africa. In collaboration with founding partners The Antiquities Coalition and Stanford Libraries, work begins to develop the platform, building on research conducted the previous year with a planning grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In late summer 2017, Qatar National Library (QNL) [joins the DLME](https://www.clir.org/2017/08/qatar-national-library-joins-international-network-partners-contributing-digital-library-middle-east/){:target="_blank"} as a founding member. Today, the [DLME](https://dlmenetwork.org/library) platform provides access to digital representations and data for nearly 134,000 items held in collections around the world, with new items added every month. An [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dlmenetwork/){:target="_blank"} account regularly highlights selected content.

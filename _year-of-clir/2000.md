In **1999**, CLIR solicits applications for the first [Frye Leadership Institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/1999/01/clir-issues-number-7/), created “to effect fundamental change in the way universities manage their information resources in the digital era.” Named for [Billy E. Frye](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/11/er_billy_frye/campus.html)—former chair of the Commission on Preservation and Access—and cosponsored with Emory University and EDUCAUSE, the [first institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/2000/01/clir-issues-number-13/) is held June 4-16, 2000, with Deanna Marcum and Richard Detweiler as co-deans and a class of 43 participants. The Frye Institute continues until 2012, and is reconstituted the following year as the [Leading Change Institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://leadingchangeinstitute.org/). Since 2000, 790 [people](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://leadingchangeinstitute.org/alumni/) have participated in Frye and LCI. _Pictured left, class of 2000._

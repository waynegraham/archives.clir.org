In **1993**, CLR awards $65,000 to Rice University’s Electronic Studio to develop the [Galileo Project,](http://galileo.rice.edu/) a hypertext, multimedia educational resource to be used in a course on the history of science in early modern Europe. In an [overview](http://galileo.rice.edu/abo/report.html) of the project, technical lead Adam Thornton describes it as “a trial balloon for the use of computing in the humanities.” Included in the Galileo Project are a comprehensive hypertextual bibliography, a collection of maps, a general timeline of European history from 1500 to 1700, and the animation of Galileo’s observations and experiments. Several members of the academic community, including a librarian, a senior faculty member in the history department, some computing professionals, and a team of student programmers, designed and developed the resource, which was first used in the spring of 1995. _Image from Galileo site: Comet of 1532 observed by Apian._

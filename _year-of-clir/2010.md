In **2009,** CLIR partners with the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) on a three-year program, “[Leadership through New Communities of Knowledge](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/2009/09/clir-issues-number-71/).” Funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the program aims to develop the leadership capacity of librarians at many of the nation’s less affluent liberal arts colleges, in particular those that serve predominantly low-income, minority, and first-generation students. The program enables librarians to attend workshops and leadership institutes; funds the development of workshops addressing the special needs of small liberal arts colleges; and creates opportunities for librarians from less affluent institutions to partner with their peers at better-financed liberal arts colleges.

In **2014,** CLIR announces a new program to fund the digitization of rare and unique content in cultural memory institutions. Funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the new program is built on the model of CLIR’s Cataloging Hidden Special Collections and Archives program, launched in 2008, which awards its final grants in 2014. The new program awards $4 million annually through 2020, funding some 85 projects. In 2021, new program funding from Mellon supports a shift in thematic focus to collections of historically marginalized people and opens eligibility to Canadian nonprofit institutions.

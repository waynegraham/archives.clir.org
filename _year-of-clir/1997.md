On May 1, **1995**, the National Digital Library Federation, composed of 15 of the nation’s largest libraries and archives plus the Commission on Preservation and Access, is formally established. (The name is officially changed to the Digital Library Federation in Sept. 1997.) The Federation’s founding members, collectively responsible for hundreds of millions of cultural, scholarly, and historical resources, agree to cooperate on defining what must be done to bring together from across the nation and beyond digitized materials that will be made accessible to students, scholars, and citizens everywhere. Today the DLF, with more than 170 member institutions across the globe, continues its work as a community of practitioners who advance research, learning, social justice, and the public good through the creative design and wise application of digital library technologies.

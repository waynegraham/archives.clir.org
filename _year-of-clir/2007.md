In **2006**, at its fall meeting, CLIR’s Board names Charles Henry CLIR president. Henry, who was then serving as vice provost and university librarian at Rice University, had been appointed to the CLIR Board the previous year. In an [essay](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/2007/03/clir-issues-number-56/) published in early 2007, Henry outlines his vision for CLIR’s role in helping to build a new research and information environment. He identifies six interrelated topics: cyberinfrastructure, preservation, the next scholar, the emerging library, leadership, and new models, that continue to characterize CLIR’s key areas of activity under his leadership.

_Today’s post has been chosen in recognition of [World Digital Preservation Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.dpconline.org/events/world-digital-preservation-day)._

In **2000**, CLIR publishes _[Authenticity in a Digital Environment](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub92/)_, a collection of papers addressing the question, “What is an authentic digital object”? Five authors—Charles T. Cullen, Peter B. Hirtle, David Levy, Clifford A. Lynch, and Jeff Rothenberg—contribute position papers that identify the attributes that define authentic digital data over time. Additional discussion is provided by Abby Smith.

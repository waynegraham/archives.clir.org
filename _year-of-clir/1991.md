In **1990**, CLR awards the American Library Associationâ€™s ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries) Rare Books and Manuscripts Section $5,000 to support a revision of the 1987 _Standards for Ethical Conduct for Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Librarians_. The revision, approved by ACRL in 1993, was again updated in 2003 as the _[Code of Ethics for Special Collections Librarians](https://rbms.info/standards/code_of_ethics/)_, which remains currently in use.

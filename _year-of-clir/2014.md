In **2013,** CLIR’s Digital Library Federation (DLF) program sponsors a panel at South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi), “[Culture Hack: Libraries & Museums Open for Making,](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP4580){:target="_blank"}” which addresses publishing collection data as an open resource to be reused by others. DLF also supports live streaming and recording of discussions from the #ideadrop House, a place for librarians to gather for salon-style group discussions about the future of libraries and academic librarianship.

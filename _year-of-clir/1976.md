In **1976**, CLR celebrates its 20th birthday. In his introduction to the 1975–76 annual report, CLR president Fred Cole writes, “The Council has long held the view that many of the needs of libraries and therefore of their users can best be served through the activities of a national library system composed of cooperating networks of various kinds and drawing upon centralized resources. … Because of its flexibility and relative independence as a private, operating foundation, the Council has often been in a position to coordinate some of these developments, to act as a mediator or catalyst when required, and to work toward ensuring that emerging systems will be compatible and contribute to an evolving national system.” [Read the 1976 annual report](https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/1976-20th-Annual-Report.pdf).

Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and in partnership with the Library of Congress. The award-winning documentary, narrated by Robert MacNeil and featuring commentary by Barbara Tuchman and James Michener, tells the story of the deterioration and destruction of the world’s intellectual heritage through the “slow fires” caused by acid paper. The film was produced in English, Spanish, and French.

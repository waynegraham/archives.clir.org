In **2010,** CLIR launches a new series of workshops on participatory design in academic libraries led by anthropologist Nancy Fried Foster. The workshops are designed to provide participants with methods and tools for including faculty members, graduate students, undergraduates, and library staff in the process of designing new library space. The series builds on previous CLIR-sponsored workshops initiated in 2007 and led by Foster for teams of library and IT professionals. More than 250 people go through the workshops in participatory design and work-practice study methods, representing 95 colleges, universities, and cultural institutions. Reports of projects stemming from the workshops are presented in the 2012 publication, _[Participatory Design in Academic Libraries: Methods, Findings, and Implementations](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub155/)_, and in the 2014 publication, _[Participatory Design in Academic Libraries: New Reports and Findings](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub161/)_.

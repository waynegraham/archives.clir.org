In **2019,** CLIR launches its podcast, _[Material Memory](https://material-memory.clir.org/)_{:target="_blank"}. The show explores how our changing world affects our ability to access the record of our shared humanity, and the critical role that libraries, archives, museums and other public institutions play in keeping cultural memory alive. [Episode Zero](https://material-memory.clir.org/2019/11/11/what-is-at-stake/){:target="_blank"}, featuring an interview with CLIR president Charles Henry, introduces the show.  [Season One](https://material-memory.clir.org/episodes/){:target="_blank"} celebrates the UN-designated Year of Indigenous Languages. In each of six episodes, host Joy Banks speaks with people involved in the work of restoring audio and audiovisual recordings of indigenous languages and their efforts to make these recordings available to the communities they represent.

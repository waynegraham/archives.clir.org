In **2020**, CLIR responds to the global pandemic. In partnership with funders and host institutions, it extends grant and fellowship periods and offers supplemental emergency funds to grantees. It invites contributions to a blog series documenting institutional and personal responses to the pandemic. And it holds the first-ever virtual DLF Forum and affiliated events, drawing some 2,200 participants, including attendees from all 50 states and 36 countries. Reflecting on the year, CLIR president Charles Henry notes, “While no organization can claim to plot a predictive course in this era of uncertainty … we will continue to adapt, adjust, pivot when necessary, and anneal on behalf of our global community, to arrive together, strengthened and wiser, in what will inevitably be a new place.”

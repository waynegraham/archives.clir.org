In October **2011,** CLIR’s DLF program and the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS) at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois [present their prototype](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ1HDn1Ayq8&list=UUuLGmD72gJDBwmLw06X58SA&index=47) for the Digital Public Library of America ([DPLA](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://dp.la/)) Beta Sprint. The project prototype leverages [DLF Aquifer](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may06/kott/05kott.html) content along with [IMLS](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.imls.gov/) Digital Collections and Content ([IMLS DCC](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/http://web.archive.org/web/20140901204756/http:/imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/))—developed through a collaboration between CIRSS and the University of Illinois Library—as a core collection for the DPLA. The DPLA “[Beta Sprint](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dpla/),” announced in May 2011, solicited models, prototypes, tools, and interfaces to demonstrate how the DPLA might index and provide access to a wide range of broadly distributed content. After more than two years of development, the DPLA is officially launched in April 2013. Today it provides access to more than 41.5 million images, texts, videos, and sounds from across the United States.

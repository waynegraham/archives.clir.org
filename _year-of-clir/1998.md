In **1997**, CLIR’s first year as a merged organization, it awards $23,000 to Yale University Library to develop [LIBLICENSE](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/http://liblicense.crl.edu/) software for drafting licensing agreements for academic research libraries. The project, initiated and overseen by Ann Shumelda Okerson—then Yale’s associate university librarian—resulted in the release of a model license in 2001; an [updated version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/http://liblicense.crl.edu/licensing-information/model-license/) was released in 2014 and is hosted by the Center for Research Libraries.

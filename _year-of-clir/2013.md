In **2012,** CLIR publishes _[One Culture. Computationally Intensive Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences](https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub151/){:target="_blank"}_, which reports on experiences of the first participants in the [Digging Into Data Challenge](https://diggingintodata.org/){:target="_blank"}. Initially sponsored by [NEH](https://www.neh.gov/){:target="_blank"}, [NSF](https://nsf.gov/){:target="_blank"}, [SSHRC](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, and [Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (additional funders subsequently joined), the Digging into Data Challenge aims to address how “big data” changes the research landscape for the humanities and social sciences. The report culminates two years of work by CLIR staff involving interviews and site visits with scholars engaged in international research collaborations involving computational analysis of large data corpora. It introduces the eight projects awarded in Round One and discusses the importance of these cases as models for the future of research in the academy.

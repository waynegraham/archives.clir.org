In **1989**, CLR awards the University of Pittsburgh $60,676 to develop an institute for government archivists focused on archival administration of electronic records. The first of five key findings of Phase 1 notes that “The archival management of electronic records is probably the most important, and certainly the most complicated, issue currently before the archival profession.” Phase 2 of the institute provides intensive instruction for the chief administrative officials of state archival agencies on the characteristics of and projected future changes in modern information systems, and to introduce them to management tools needed for operating in that new environment. A report on the institute, [_Archival Administration in the Electronic Information Age: An Advanced Institute for Government Archivists_](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED331470.pdf){:target="_blank"}, was published the following year.

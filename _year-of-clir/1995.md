In December **1994**, the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Research Libraries Group create the Task Force on Archiving of Digital Information to investigate the means of ensuring “continued access indefinitely into the future of records stored in digital electronic form.” Chaired by John Garrett of CyberVillages Corporation and Donald Waters of Yale University, the task force publishes _[Preserving Digital Information](https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/pub63watersgarrett.pdf)_ in May 1996. The report underscores the need to protect digital information from both media deterioration and technological obsolescence, and highlights the crucial role of creators in helping ensure access to the digital resources they produce. It receives the Society of American Archivists’ Preservation Publication Award in 1997.

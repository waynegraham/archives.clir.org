In **1984**, CLR awards $50,000 to the Association of American Publishers (AAS) to develop a standard set of codes for identifying various portions of manuscripts in electronic form, building on past work by the Graphic Communications Association, American National Standards Institute, and the International Standards Organization (ISO). By June 1986, AAS had published a provisional standard, _Basic Author’s Guide to Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup_, and had presented its recommendations to NISO and ISO. In October 1986, ISO approved International Standard 8879, Information Processing—Text and Office Systems—Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), for broad use in conventional and electronic publishing. _[Photo by Mike Cowlishaw, CC BY-SA 3.0.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=534747)_ [Read more](https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/07/SGML-7-16-20.pdf).

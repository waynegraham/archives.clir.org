In **2003**, CLIR [invites applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/2003/11/clir-issues-number-36/) for a new program offering postdoctoral fellowships for humanists in libraries. The goal is to give recent PhD graduates the chance to develop research tools, resources, and services while exploring new career opportunities. In spring 2004, the first cohort of 11 fellows is [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/2004/05/clir-issues-number-39/); among them is Christa Williford, who eventually joins the CLIR staff and is today senior director of research and assessment. As of 2020, the [Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/) has supported 215 fellows at 93 host institutions. About half of former fellows are employed in libraries and half in adjunct or tenure-track positions. 2013 fellow and CLIR program officer Jodi Reeves Eyre currently manages the program. _Photo, clockwise from lower left: fellow Patricia Hswe; summer seminar leader Elliott Shore; fellows Daphne Rentfrow, Meg Norcia, Ben Huang, Dawn Schmitz, Amanda French, and Amanda Watson._

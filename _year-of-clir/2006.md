In **2005**, CLIR published two reports addressing laws, policies, and issues relating to recorded sound, an especially challenging class of holdings for libraries and archives in terms of preservation and access. _[Survey of Reissues of US Recordings](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub133/)_, by Tim Brooks, and _[Copyright Issues Relevant to Digital Preservation and Dissemination of Pre-1972 Commercial Sound Recordings by Libraries and Archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub135/)_, by June Besek, were issued as part of a broader congressionally supported [partnership](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/2001/09/clir-issues-number-23/) with the Library of Congress forged in 2001, and which grew to focus on recorded sound heritage. By 2012, CLIR had published eight reports on behalf of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program ([NDIIPP](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.digitalpreservation.gov/)) and the [National Recording Preservation Board](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/about-this-program), culminating in _[The Library of Congress National Recording Preservation Plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214829/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub156/)._

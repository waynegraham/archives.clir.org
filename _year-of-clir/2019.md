In **2018,** CLIR’s Digital Library Federation (DLF) program partners with the HBCU Library Alliance to launch the three-year [Authenticity Project](https://www.diglib.org/announcing-the-authenticity-project/){:target="_blank"} with funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services ([IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/){:target="_blank"}). The project provides mentoring, learning, and leadership opportunities for 45 early- to mid-career librarians from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as well as frameworks for conversation and collaboration among dozens of additional participants from DLF and HBCU member institutions. [Fifteen fellows](https://www.diglib.org/introducing-the-2019-authenticity-project-fellows/){:target="_blank"} are selected for 2019. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the program takes a hiatus in 2020, but resumes in 2021 with support from faculty with expertise in online mentoring and community building.

description: "This report contains nine case studies of colleges and mid-sized universities whose libraries have used new information technologies to improve education on their campuses. Funded by a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, members of CLIR staff and one of its advisory groups, the College Libraries Committee, studied the experience of college libraries that use new information technology to enhance library services and provide information resources to students and faculty in innovative ways. The nine colleges and mid-sized universities that participated in the study are: the California Institute of Technology; Carnegie Mellon University; Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis; Lafayette College; Point Park College; Southern Utah University; Stevens Institute of Technology; West Virginia Wesleyan College; and Wellesley College.


Included at the beginning of the report are summaries of presentations made at a follow-up conference to discuss the studies and ideas for making change in higher education."

title: "Dimension and Use of the Scholarly Information Environment"
clir_id: dlf026
description: "The backdrop for this study is that the Digital Library Federation (DLF) has become increasingly
concerned by the absence of reliable information with which to document and explain changing
patterns of library use in universities and colleges. DLF repeatedly hears from academic library
directors that such analyses are vital but missing ingredients of their strategic planning, and of
the business case they make to faculty and senior administrators either to win or bolster support
for the library and its changing directions."

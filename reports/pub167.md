description: "This volume celebrates the first decade of CLIRâ€™s [Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/) by bringing together 20 past and present CLIR postdoctoral fellows to share their thoughts on their experiences and, more broadly, on the direction of academia. Each essay is a look into the working conditions associated with creating a new profession of expertise and responsibilities in response to emerging forms of scholarly communication and pedagogy."

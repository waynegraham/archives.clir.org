# On the Preservation of Books and Documents in Original Form

Barclay Ogden<br>
October 1989

The national preservation program can save the contents of millions of
brittle books through mass microfilming, but many library materials with
scholarly value as artifacts also are in need of preservation. This paper
provides an intellectual rationale for consideration of the book as an
artifact and discusses possible selection strategies to provide a context
for further exploration of these issues.

## Introduction

Some books and documents must be preserved in original form because they
have scholarly value as objects as well as for the information they contain.
The challenge of preserving these materials, called artifacts, requires
an understanding of the scholarly value of artifacts and the development
of an effective and efficient strategy for their preservation.

Research libraries and archives collect information recorded on paper,
film, and, more recently, analog or digital tape and disks, all of which
have finite life spans. When the original paper, film, and other information
media or “formats” deteriorate sufficiently to threaten loss of the information
recorded on them, a major preservation decision needs to be made: If the
information is to be preserved, what is the most effective and economical
preservation technology to use?

The decision can be difficult because no preservation technology is perfect;
some information is lost in order to save other information, and decisions
are made to save what is regarded at the time as information most likely
to be of enduring scholarly value. Libraries and archives are filled with
examples of compromises made to preserve some information at the expense
of information considered to be of less importance. Microfilms and photocopies
capture text but commonly lose much of the detail and tonal range of illustrations.
Repairs and restorations alter original books and documents, no matter
how carefully they are done. Even library bindings change forever the appearance
of books as published by replacing original, sometimes illustrated, covers
with serviceable, if unappealing, buckram.

For books and documents whose scholarly value lies entirely in a reasonably
faithful representation of text and illustrations, the choice of an appropriate
preservation technology can be made on the bases of technical fidelity
of various reformatting technologies, the kind of access needed to the
preserved information, and relative costs. For many materials of scholarly
value at risk of loss from deterioration, microfilm is the preservation
technology of choice because microfilm “captures” text well, and the text
is of greatest scholarly value.

For materials valued for detailed, continuous-tone or multicolored illustrations,
microfilm has not proven to be a good preservation technology. Moreover,
materials made less useful by reformatting from paper to microfilm because
the mode of access is less satisfactory are not considered good candidates
for this preservation technology.

Even more challenging is the preservation of books and documents whose
original formats have scholarly value as objects. These materials have
scholarly value that encompasses both the value of the text and illustrations
and, additionally, an object or artifact” value that is inseparable from
the original format of the materials. They cannot be microfilmed without
loss of part of their scholarly value. But exactly what are artifacts,
what is their importance to scholarship, and how can artifacts be preserved
effectively and economically?

## Artifacts and Information

Artifacts are often thought of in terms of rarity or uniqueness, age,
and monetary worth. Although these characteristics frequently are found
in artifacts, they do not of themselves determine scholarly value. Many
books and documents are old and rare but contain little scholarly value,
while some new documents may be of great importance. Similarly, the monetary
value of some documents as collectors’ items has little relation to those
documents’ importance to scholarship.

Most artifacts are valued primarily as evidence or proof of the accuracy
of the information they contain. Original documents are essential for many
legal and scholarly purposes as proof of authenticity. The authenticity
of text, even its legal credibility, may depend on an analysis of the format.
Erasure marks impressed upon the surface of a hand-drawn map warn that
a location or boundary may have been falsified. Pages tipped into already
bound books sometimes suggest that parts of texts may have been changed.
Pasted-on changes to a typescript distinguish an author’s original words
from those that found their way into print.

An original document is proof or evidence of how (and sometimes when and
where) the document was made: the type of paper with its watermark printing
or writing ink, the binding materials, glues, leather, and cloth. This
evidence constitutes information about the history of the technologies
involved in the manufacture of the document and often can help determine
the date of an undated or inaccurately dated document.

Some artifacts are preserved because they are exceptionally fine examples
of their technology or are artistic expressions. Some manuscripts, prints,
drawings, and photographs made to record historical events were so finely
done that they have acquired aesthetic value as well as value as historical
documents. Some bookbindings are not only exquisite examples of their craft
but also are artistic expressions wrought in leather, thus taking on the
value of museum objects.

In all of the above examples, the format itself has something to contribute
to the understanding of the book or document. Whether proof’ of authenticity, “evidence” of
manufacture, or technological or artistic expression,” at least part of
the scholarly value of the record is inseparable from its format. Can a
copy, no matter how good, of a book or document offer the same proof of
authenticity as the book or document in original form? (The admissibility
in court of copies of original documents grapples with part of this question.)
How can a facsimile provide evidence of the original manufacture of a book
or document? Perhaps some forms of artistic expression would be less dependent
upon original format if we had a preservation technology that could precisely
duplicate the original and thus carry the same expression, but to date
there is no preservation technology with this capability.

When the original form or format contributes to the scholarly value of
the record, the record becomes an artifact. Consequently, the original
format of an artifact cannot be destroyed without reducing the record’s
scholarly value. From the perspective of making a preservation decision,
should not we consider the original format to be “information” of scholarly
value comparable to the words and illustrations more typically thought
of as information?

By considering artifacts as information, artifacts could be subjected
to the same scholarly and technical review given to all records considered
for preservation. Books and documents valued exclusively for their contents
currently are preserved only if that information is deemed to be of sufficient
scholarly value to justify the cost of its preservation. Analogously, artifacts
would be preserved only if their “information” is deemed of sufficient
scholarly importance to merit preservation, knowing that preserving these
materials means preserving them in original format.

Though not the primary consideration of this paper, in addition to artifacts
there is a second category of books and documents that must be preserved
in original format. These are library materials whose information cannot
be captured by the currently available reformatting technologies of microfilming
or photocopying. Art and art history, archaeology, architecture, geology,
geography, the life sciences, and other subjects are heavily dependent
upon illustrations that feature fine details, continuous tone, and color.
Moreover, illustrated materials often are published in oversized formats
with frequent foldouts. All of these characteristics make demands beyond
the capabilities of filming and photocopying. Digitization is likely to
overcome many of the limitations of current technologies, but it is not
yet available for preservation applications. While they are not artifacts
as described above, many illustrated materials also must be preserved in
original form until a suitable reformatting technology is available for
their preservation.

With many materials, and illustrated materials in particular, satisfactory
preservation solutions are further limited by requirements for access.
For example, comparisons among illustrations in art history texts require
consultation of several images simultaneously, a difficult feat on a film
or fiche reader. Reference books need random access for quick look-ups,
which are not at all suited to the sequential access of the microfilm format.
Thus the reformatting technology not only must capture all significant
information, but also must provide quality of access equal to that of the
original format if it is to be fully satisfactory.

If all books and documents of significant scholarly value are to be preserved,
including artifacts and library materials for which a suitable preservation
technology is not yet available, we must extend our efforts to preserve
some records in original format. The information value of some formats
in and of themselves, limitations of current preservation technologies
to capture all significant information, and occasional special requirements
for access indicate a need for a strategy for preservation of selected
books and documents in original form.

## A Strategy for Reservation in Original Format
Traditionally, libraries and archives independently have undertaken activities
to preserve their collections by providing proper housing, protection from
fire and theft, library binding, and occasional repair and restoration.
Now libraries with custody of the nation’s research collections realize
that a greater commitment of library resources is required to preserve
their very large, deteriorating collections. The single, but monumental,
problem of deterioration of library collections caused by embrittlement
of paper alone has drawn considerable national attention along with additional
Perhaps the least obvious (and most commonly overlooked) problem with the
effectiveness of any preservation technology that reproduces or alters
the original, no matter how “faithful” the reproduction or unobtrusive
the alteration, is that the scholar is left with information less reliably
accurate than that in the unaltered original format. Consequently, a preservation
strategy for artifacts might include a guideline that no treatment should
be undertaken unless the risk of damage from delay or inaction is judged
to be the greater risk.

A preservation treatment must be appropriate and economical. Its appropriateness
is measured by its ability to capture all information of significance.
The scholar must be prepared to identify now what information is significant
for current and future study in order to ensure that it is captured. Can
a scholar always tell a conservator which attributes of an artifact are
significant and must be preserved? The remote possibility of identifying
all artifactual information that will in the future be significant about
a book or document, combined with the inherent compromises between information
saved and information lost during the preservation treatment process, appears
to argue further for a preservation strategy to restrict extensive preservation
treatment only to books and documents that have artifactual significance
and that are in urgent need of treatment.

Some treatments used to preserve materials in their original formats are
very expensive. “Full conservation,” or restoration, including chemical
treatment and repair done to minimize its visual intrusiveness, can cost
several hundred to more than a thousand dollars per book or document, depending
on extensiveness of treatment. Relatively few artifacts can justify the
costs of extensive preservation treatment but, fortunately, not all artifacts
in need of preservation require extensive treatment. Most artifact treatments
undertaken in many institutional preservation programs are minor, but are
sufficient to enable the continued safe use of artifacts at a per item
cost of less than fifty dollars.

The vast majority of all artifacts could be preserved without treatment
and at low cost through preservation measures to reduce their rates of
deterioration and wear, thereby extending their lives and minimizing the
number of artifacts in need of treatment at any one time. Controlling the
environment (temperature, relative humidity, air impurities, and light
levels) reduces the rate of deterioration; protective enclosures mitigate
the effects of a poor environment or housing arrangement and reduce wear;
sensible handling and use practices help preserve artifacts for many decades
of continued research. Soon chemical treatment, ‘mass deacidification,” will
be available to reduce the rate of chemically caused deterioration. These
measures could be the major components of a strategy for artifact preservation,
with extensive treatment as a relatively minor component.

As with preservation of all library and archival materials, a strategy
for preservation of books and documents in original format needs to encompass
a justification for resources, methodologies for selection (assuming fewer
resources than needs), and a range of preservation technologies able to
match problems with solutions. Certainly artifacts could be claimed to
have scholarly value sufficient to justify significant resources for their
preservation. A preservation strategy could be crafted to meet the needs
of both the most important artifacts and those most at risk. But the success
of the effort will depend upon the involvement of scholars and librarians
not only in identifying books and documents that must be preserved in original
format, but in fully understanding the nature of the preservation problem
to be solved and in developing a strategy for its solution.

Librarians and scholars are vitally interested in developing strategies
and establishing priorities for choosing which materials to preserve when
not everything can be saved. This report is intended to stimulate further
thinking on the part of the community of scholars who must have a voice
in selection strategies.

## Introduction

There are more library books and journals in need of preservation today
than can possibly be saved before they crumble and disappear. Accordingly,
we cannot afford to spend resources on the preservation of materials that
are unimportant. Choices must be made, and made with the best available
advice as to the future scholarly value of the information to be saved.

The problem of brittle books arises from the acidic paper on which most
books and journals were printed from 1860 to 1920, and the temperature
and humidity conditions under which these volumes have been stored. About
30 million books in U.S. Libraries are, sooner or later, doomed to turn
brown, brittle, and unusable. The problem is a national, not a local one,
and only a concerted national effort has any hope of rescuing our cultural
heritage. Libraries must cooperate in lending their salvageable volumes
to the task and the federal government is the only possible source of sufficient
funding. The result must therefore be a national collection, accessible
to all scholars.

## Some Distinctions

In this paper, “preservation” is used to mean saving the content of a
brittle book whether through a gross transformation such as microfilming
its pages, encoding its languages electronically, or reprinting it. Conserving” or
‘ restoring” the original item refers to attempts to save the physical
artifact as well. The choice of mode may depend upon the rarity, uniqueness
or special features (e.g., illustrations, typography) of the item, as well
as upon the feasibility and cost of the technology employed. For the greatest
part of the problem, microfilming appears currently to be the preferable
mode of storage for preservation, although replication in other media from
the storage microfilm may be preferable for use.

Manuscripts and archives also cry out for preservation or conservation,
but present different problems than scholarly monographs and serials do.
The latter are better known, defined, and classified than archives are,
and constitute a somewhat more manageable problem because they are kept
in well-ordered fashion in large collections that offer better accessibility
for purposes of preservation. Printed works also serve a larger constituency
than most archives do and their relative uniformity (compared to archival
materials) makes them easier to process on a mass scale. Finally, the existing
bibliographic network for printed works can be used advantageously in selecting
items to be preserved and in minimizing duplication of effort among preservation
projects. In view of the urgency of the preservation task printed works
seem the best place to begin. Success in this area will pave the way for
further support in others.

## Disciplinary Differences
The needs and objectives of preservation vary widely across the several
fields of scholarship. Literary and historical studies make much greater
use of monographs, diaries and memoirs than the physical and biological
sciences, where greater reliance is placed on journal articles and conference
reports.

Correspondingly, in those areas of scholarship that focus on the movement
and transformation of ideas; changes in the text of novels, plays, and
poems; and connections among the cultural products of different eras and
different places, there is often a demand for more extensive preservation–of
each of the variant editions of a text, or each of several reproductions
of a work of art. Such studies of stylistic or substantive variation are
concerned with the changes or differences themselves in a work or a genre
that is nominally the “same.” The need for multiple versions is not merely
scholarly scrupulosity. Furthermore, in some subjects the preserved collection
should knowingly include secondary, “inferior” or “popular” material, for
scholars sometimes want to know everything that was being said about a
subject even by tendentious or inaccurate writers.

Students of history (in any area) present a particular problem for a preservation
strategy, for their scholarly mills can grind any kind of written or pictorial
matter into historical grain. In principle, there is no topic, no place,
no people, no event or sequence of events about which an historical account
cannot be written. While the most trivial and frivolous topics are ruled
out by the canons of scholarship, there is nonetheless a vast body of material
whose preservation can be justified on the theory that someday someone
will want to trace the historical changes in it or relate them to another
body of material. Given such amplitude of potential resources, a strategy
of selective sampling from some bodies of material–war veterans’ memoirs
for example–is justified. Such caveats do not necessarily apply to the
product of historical analysis, however, for the accomplished history of
any topic, place, sequence of events, and so forth may be justified as
a portion of the cultural record of the society in which it existed.

On the other hand, in the disciplines that accumulate knowledge by discovery
of new data and revision of established principles, such as the physical
and life sciences, the opposite is generally true. Working scientists are
usually interested in the latest version of a book or the latest number
of a journal. Great effort goes into updating, revising, and keeping current.
Active investigators and teachers of science generally believe that most
essential knowledge from the past is, for their purposes, adequately represented
in text books, handbooks, and reference works. The earlier (and usually
inaccurate or mistaken) theories, observations or inferences are discarded
to the historian of science, not cherished for their current usefulness.

It appears, therefore, that the preservation problem is most pressing
in the arts and humanities and, correspondingly for the reason cited, the
choices of what to preserve or conserve are the most difficult.

## Approaches to Selection

Ideally, a selection strategy would invoke the most informed and prescient
scholarly opinion about the future importance of each individual publication.
there is neither labor enough nor time to make such a title-by-title approach
feasible, however, even in a limited area, as a group of classicists, working
collaboratively to preserve a mere 20,000 volumes, discovered. some less
fine-grained strategy is necessary, and a couple suggest themselves.

One is a “great collections” approach that begins with an evaluation of
the relative strength of collections by classification–e.g., the research
libraries group conspectus. this inquiry produced a ranking of comprehensiveness
of various libraries in specific subject areas–e.g., american history,
philosophy, linguistics, medieval english literature. collections identified
as “comprehensive” could be microfilmed in their entirety. indeed, it could
be persuasively argued that since such collections had been identified,
they should be the first to be filmed, in their entireties, for preservation.
it is often more efficient to preserve all the material in a particular
category than to deliberate lengthily about the relative importance of
specific titles.

The wisdom of a “great collections” approach is usually apparent to scholars,
once they have become familiar enough with the parameters of the preservation
problem to appreciate the magnitude of effort required and the urgency
of the task such consciousness-raising is essential furthermore, to the
success of the preservation initiative, which cannot succeed without the
understanding support of the academic community. a distinct effort of a
particular sort needs to be made in this connection. scholars are ordinarily
not familiar with the strength of library collections outside their own
special fields, and indeed, may not be able to evaluate confidently the
strength of collections outside their own university’s. further, many scholars
have become accustomed to a title-by-title approach through a lifetime
of judicious discrimination among individual authors, specific topics,
stringently defined periods and other punctuate features of their intellectual
arenas of work. they may initially resist what they perceive as a sweeping
indiscriminateness of the “great collections” approach.

The scholarly community can be of great help in clarifying the requirements
of research, advising on which materials are of little or no use, and which
are essential for an academic discipline. scholars can help to make the
judgment as to whether to preserve all of the items in a particular category
or to choose a representative sample when there is great homogeneity of
content among separate items–e.g., memoirs of war veterans, victorian
moral philosophical tracts, self-help books.

Another approach, suitable for small segments of a scholarly field, is
the use of an existing scholarly bibliography that presumably identifies
the most significant work in, say, british empiricist philosophy or indic
philology during a particular era when materials are known to be at greatest
risk of embrittlement. alternatively, an individual scholar or group of
scholarly specialists can draw up lists of authors whose work is considered
important.

A variation of this approach involves enlisting the aid of the highly
specialized sub-societies that can be found in most scholarly fields. for
example, more than a dozen specialized interest groups in philosophy cover
a range of topics: the leibniz society and the medieval and renaissance
philosophical society, for example. members of such highly specialized
groups can bring a particular perspective to bear upon a bibliography of
the larger scholarly discipline and make judgments about its contents–or
construct their own specialized lists.

In the latter approaches, whatever the source of the bibliography or the
category of material, it constitutes simply the first step in selection,
and must be followed by bibliographic cross-checking (e.g., through oclc
or rlg records) to determine whether a preserved version of the item either
exists or is planned. thirdly, a cooperative source, usually a university
library, must be located to lend the item for the preservation process.

It is important to inform scholars about the need for preservation as
well as the constraints– financial. logistic and temporal–that surround
the process and equally important to involve them in making decisions about
preservation. scholars’ understanding of the process that is developed
for deciding what to preserve and its credibility are essential for overcoming
resistance and for generating support. this need is particularly acute
in view of the apparent necessity to choose a preservation process–microfilming–that
has a bad name in the academic community generally. technically imperfect,
carelessly executed microfilming has made even more unwelcome a medium
that is greatly disdained in comparison to the familiarity and convenience
of the bound book. a little direct experience handling the crumbling pages
that can be found in any library, however, is a powerfully convincing argument
in favor of preservation now–but the path toward that goal needs to be
explored and discovered collaboratively on the part of librarians and scholars
in order to reach it.

## Factors Affecting Choice of an Approach
The urgency of preservation of the intellectual estate of the nation demands
that the task be done expeditiously, while its vastness requires that it
be done economically. Both of these dimensions urge that the strategies
chosen be as simple and straightforward as possible, manageable by a wide
variety of libraries, a broad spectrum of scholarship and a large assortment
of materials. In an ideal world, unlimited resources and vast amounts of
time would allow item-by-item selection on the part of scholars, exquisitely
careful bibliographic checking by librarians, and restoration of the conserved
(as well as preserved) work to the shelves of its lending institution.
In the real world, all of these features must be compromised.

The issue of cost is crucial, given the vast quantity of deteriorating
paper in libraries, and the cost of selection cannot be allowed to consume
a disproportionate share of the total cost of preservation. As noted above,
there are opportunities for economies in the logistics of preservation,
and there clearly are economies of scale. Scholarly judgment is of the
utmost importance in identifying important bodies of material, but it may
be wiser as well as more economic not to attempt item-by-item selection
but to sweep all of the items in a particular category/collection into
the preservation process. Similarly, if the machine-searchable bibliographic
networks of the country do not evidence the existence of a duplicate preserved
item, that may be signal enough to include the item in the preservation
process, even though we know that not all of the collections of all libraries
are included in that database.

An important logistic issue concerns the willingness of libraries to collaborate
by lending portions of their collection to a preservation process. The
evidence of willing cooperation is, to date, immense. Yet there are signs
that there may be resistance, especially on the part of faculty, to a collaboration
that involves sacrifice of a volume or its non-return to the shelves of
the university library. While librarians may be ready to recognize that,
in order to retain scholarly content, it is reasonable to “destroy” a physical
object before it self-destructs, faculty sometimes mourn or even rage.
Such postures could have a distinct bearing upon selection for preservation.

The national program of preservation does not have a well-marked road
ahead to travel, but the direction it must take is clear enough. Enough
at-risk literature has been identified to justify an immediately increased
effort to preserve it, and this effort will teach us much about the task.
We do not know exactly what to do step-by-step, but we know what needs
to be done: enlarge the involvement of scholars and librarians in the process,
explain it to a generally sympathetic public and legislature, and learn
as we go how to do the job better.

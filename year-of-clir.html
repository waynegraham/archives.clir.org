        In January 2020, CLIR launched a weekly series, “Year of CLIR,” highlighting key activity from each year since its founding in 1956. As CLIR celebrates its 65th anniversary, we are grateful to the many people, funders, and other organizations—several acknowledged in these posts—that have made our work possible.

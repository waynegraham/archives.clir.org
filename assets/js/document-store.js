Amy Friedlander is special projects associate at the Council on Library and Information Resources She is primarily responsible for CLIRaposs work with the Library of Congress on its National Digital Information Infrastructure Preservation Program NDIIPP Before joining CLIR she was the founding editor of DLib Magazine and iMP The Magazine on Information Impacts She has published on the implications of higher education for the historical role of women and on the history of largescale technologybased infrastructures Preface We know from anecdotal evidence that usersapos expectations of libraries are changing as they find more information directly from the Web Anecdotal evidence though is hardly enough for developing persuasive plans for new library services The Digital Library Federation DLF and Council on Library and Information Resources CLIR commissioned Outsell Inc to conduct a largescale study of undergraduates graduate students and faculty members from academic institutions ranging from the small liberal arts college to the largest research university Our hope was that a picture of user behavior would emerge This report presents a summary of the findings and 158 selected data tables it should be viewed as an entry to a much larger data set The full set of 659 data tables provided by Outsell will be mounted on CLIRaposs or DLFaposs Web site We encourage readers to make use of these tables and ask that you share with us your analyses of the data In addition CLIR will deposit the raw data tapes with the InterUniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research ICPSR CLIR and DLF expect to commission additional work based on the data We welcome proposals from readers with an interest in performing more detailed studies Deanna B Marcum President CLIR Introduction Academic and research libraries face numerous challenges in managing their information resources in the digital age Like many other organizations the Digital Library Federationhttpswwwdigliborg DLF has become concerned about changing patterns of information use for teaching learning and research and about the implications of these patterns for libraries and library directors who require reliable information for strategic planning In collaboration with the Council on Library and Information Resourceshttpswwwclirorg CLIR and Outsell Inchttpswwwoutsellinccom the DLF has initiated a planning and research process to understand how library use is changing and to support future investigation and analysis The survey conducted by Outsell and described herein is only one of several activities under way or recently completed Related projects include A survey by DLF Distinguished Fellow Denise Troll Covey of methods applied by leading research libraries to assess the use and usability of online collections and services Troll Covey 2002httpswwwclirorgpubsreportspub105 A survey by former DLF Director Daniel Greenstein and Indiana University Dean of Libraries Suzanne Thorin of the policy organizational and financial environments in which leading research libraries are developing their digital libraries Greenstein and Thorin 2002httpswwwclirorgpubsreportspub109 A study by Charles McClure and colleagues into methods of assessing quality in digital reference services McClure et al 2002httpquartzsyreduquality Outsell developed the survey questionnaire with guidance from the DLF advisory group on user studies Interviews began in fall 2001 and continued over two and onehalf months The primary goal of the survey questionnaire was to collect data on the relevance of existing and possible future services as well as on student and faculty perceptions of the librarys value in the context of the scholarly information environment Other objectives included determining 1 what information resources are used to support research teaching and learning and 2 how those sources and services are located evaluated and used by faculty and students at different kinds of institutions of higher education and in different disciplines It is expected that the data will support evaluations of the librarys current and potential future roles as well as more detailed studies on the development and use of collections This report includes 158 of the 659 data tables provided by Outsell a few summary observations and a brief discussion of some possible implications of the findings In addition to publishing this report CLIR and DLF will post to the Web all 659 of the data tables and will deposit the raw data tapes with the InterUniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research ICPSRhttpswwwicpsrumicheduwebpages11 In this document the tables have been grouped in three categories 1 Faculty and Students 2 Infrastructure Facilities and Services and 3 Formats The information presented in the tables overlaps to some extent however the tables included in Faculty and Students primarily contain data about who participated and what they do Tables included in Infrastructure Facilities and Services contain data related to where faculty and students access information Finally tables grouped within Formats contain comparative data on the formats and media that faculty and students use for research teaching and coursework Data Collection ",

measurements economic and financial series and government statistics are vital resources for research and education in a variety of disciplines concerned with advancing the study of individuals and society For decades these data have been encoded stored and used primarily in digital form Custodians who have collected maintained and provided access to numeric data resources thus have been building and managing digital librariesand scholars and students have been effectively using them in the pursuit of historical social and scientific studies long before the term digital library came into wide currency Those who are grappling with an explosion of digital information in a dizzying range of formats have much to learn from social science data librarians and users who have relatively long experience in managing and working with digital resources Data producers librarians and scholarly users have come to invest in very sophisticated mechanisms for storing and distributing social science data They have achieved valuable economies of scale in data storage and delivery through consortial developments such as the data archives held by the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research ICPSR Through years of experience with repeated changes in storage technologies and in the software for encoding and using the data they have become particularly adept at the longterm maintenance of information in digital form In 1996 the Task Force on Archiving of Digital Information highlighted the difficulties of preserving digital information over long periods of time As a way of addressing these difficulties the task force recommended in part that its sponsors the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Research Libraries Group seek to document the experiences of communities already well practiced in the preservation of digital information Responding to this recommendation the Commission which has since merged with the Council on Library Resources to become the Council on Library and Information Resources CLIR sought out the expertise of those managing universitybased data archives It contracted for the development of this paper with the authors who at the time worked together in managing the Social Science Data Archives at Yale University one of the oldest data archives in American universities Preserving the Whole appears as the second publication of the Digital Library Federation and reflects the Federations interests both in advancing the state of the art of social science data archives and in building the infrastructure necessary for the longterm maintenance of digital information The paper is especially valuable as a meticulously detailed case study of migration as a preservation strategy It explores the options available for migrating both data stored in a technically obsolete format and their associated documentation stored on paper which may itself be rapidly deteriorating The obsolete data format known as column binary was born in the same era of creatively parsimonious coding techniques that have given rise to the widely publicized Year 2000 Y2K computer problems Beyond its contributions to our understanding of migration as a particular strategy for the longterm maintenance of digital information Preserving the Whole also provides more general lessons It is a remarkable finding of this study that the column binary format although technically obsolete is so well documented that numerous options exist not just for migrating column binary files to other formats but also for reading them in their native format Moreover the authors make the important observation that data sets will be indecipherable and cannot survive at all regardless of the file format in which they are stored if there is no effort made also to preserve their codebooks A codebook is essential documentation that relates the numeric data to meaningful fields and values of information From more theoretical perspectives Jeff Rothenberg 1999 and David Bearman 1999 both emphasize the critical importance of documentation or metadata for preserving digital information The value of Preserving the Whole is that it makes a similar argument but concretely and from the long experience of the data community in effectively managing digital information Donald J Waters Background and Project Description In December 1994 the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Research Libraries Group created the Task Force on Archiving of Digital Information The purpose of the task force was to investigate the means of ensuring continued access indefinitely into the future of records stored in digital electronic form Digital media are more fragile than paper and become unreadable more quickly because of changes in operating systems and applications software and the deterioration of physical media and because no organization has accepted responsibility for preservation In its definitive 1996 report Preserving Digital Information the task force warned that owners or custodians who can no longer bear the expense and difficulty of migration will deliberately or inadvertently through a simple failure to act destroy the objects without regard for future use The task forces warning echoed the growing realization by researchers who were using social science statistical data in digital form and specialists who were archiving these data that major rescue efforts to identify locate and preserve computer files produced with rapidly outmoded technology could not be postponed Because access to social science numeric data requires metadataaccompanying paper or machinereadable recordsthe loss of the metadata can also mean the loss of the data file The two approaches to preservation of digital files under evaluation in the early 1990s were refreshing and migration Refreshing refers to the copying of information from one medium to another without changing the format or internal structure of the records in the files Refreshing digital information will suffice as long as software exists to manipulate the format of the files Since digital information is produced in varying degrees of dependence upon particular hardware and software refreshing cannot serve as a general solution for preserving digital information The task force emphasized migration of digital information designed to achieve the periodic transfer of digital materials from one hardwaresoftware configuration to another or from one generation of computer technology to a subsequent generation Migration includes refreshing the media but also addresses the internal structure of the files so that the information within can be read on subsequent computer platforms operating systems and software The Yale Social Science Data Preservation Project In 1996 the Commission on Preservation and Access commissioned the Social Science Library and the Social Science Statistical Laboratory at Yale Statlab to identify and evaluate the formats that would most likely provide the ability to migrate social science statistical data and accompanying documentation 1 into future technical environments The Yale University Library one of the first academic libraries to form a collection of machinereadable data began acquiring social science numeric data in 1972 Over the years Yale has copied its data from one form of digital storage to another as mainframe computer technology has dictated The copying of data while laborintensive was straightforward in creating exact logical copies from outofdate media in newer data storage formats In the mid1990s as data use was moving from the mainframe to distributed computing systems and from one hardwaresoftware configuration to another digital formats began to require not just simple duplication but restructuring Files produced by standard statistical software on mainframes had to be converted into platformindependent formats before moving to personal computers In addition data stored on magnetic tapes had to be moved to new media as access to and support in using the Yale mainframe was discontinued 1 At its first occurance a word defined in the Glossary is shown in bold Our social science data preservation project team was headed by Ann Green director Statlab and JoAnn Dionne data librarian Social Science Library with the assistance of Martin Dennis consultant Statlab and graduate student psychology We began our work in June 1996 during a time when many academic institutions were in the process of transferring numeric social science data sets from mainframe environments to PC and UNIXbased networks Large collections of numeric data had been successfully moved across these platforms Considerably less attention had been directed toward the greater problem of developing systemindependent archival formats while also preserving and digitizing the accompanying paper records metadata that must be available to analyze the data sets We were thus faced with a twotrack preservation approach converting deteriorating paper the documentation to digital form and migrating digitized numeric data to an archival format that can be read by future operating systems and applications software The Yale University Library had taken a lead in digitizing for preservation Conway 1996 and we built on that base in digitizing the paper records accompanying the data file The Statlab had taken a lead in migrating data collections from mainframedependent tape storage to networked online storage and we built on that base in restructuring and migrating the numeric files On the documentation track we scanned printed textual material for 10 surveys selected from the Yale Roper Collection and evaluated the outcomes of applying optical character recognition OCR creating image files and producing Adobe Portable Document Format PDF files On the data track we investigated diligently and in detail the implications of preserving data in their original format vs migrating to restructured formats We evaluated the alternative formats for migrating the original data files from tape and focused upon the benefits and drawbacks of each alternative Details are covered in the Findings and Recommendations section of this report While evaluations of computer storage media should not be ignored in an overall strategy for planning the future costs and viability of data collections we did not include media evaluations in this project Nor did we research the intellectual property issues involved in conversion leaving that to a later discussion However there is a longestablished ethic in the social science data community that data documentation should be shared freely For example the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research ICPSR recently began making all its machinereadable documentation freely accessible on the Internet At the end of the project in the fall of 1997 we developed a collection of information including sample programs and documents relevant to the project and made it available at the Statlab Web page of the Yale Web site The collection of information has since moved to the Council on Library and Information Resources Web site at StatLabpreservingthewholesupplementarymaterials Included in the materials accessible at this site are a link to the Interim Report to the Commission on Preservation and Access

the Roper Center whose data sets comprise a rich resource for research in political psychology and sociology They provide a record of public opinion research in the United States from 1935 to the present along with surveys conducted abroad since the 1940s In addition to the data files the Yale Roper Collection includes paper records such as questionnaires information on sample sizes and other notes necessary for use of the data files Many of the paper records are brittle have handwritten notes and were produced through unstable copying technologies such as mimeography The first step in the project was to select a representative group of documents and accompanying data files from the collection Our initial discussions led us to select the Roper Reports a significant heavily used part of the Yale Roper Collection The Roper Reports have been produced since 1973 by the Roper Organization a commercial polling company now known as Roper Starch Worldwide Inc The Roper Reports have 15002000 respondents 200300 variables and polling for the reports is conducted 10 times per year in the United States Data files contain demographic information such as age sex race economic level education marital status union membership religious and political affiliation and responses to questions on a broad array of issues facing society such as energy politics media health and medical care consumer behavior education and foreign policy The Roper Reports in the Yale Roper Collection do not have machinereadable documentation supplied with the data files The documentation consists of paper photocopies of questionnaires and computer output Some parts of the documentation are poorly duplicated copies with blurred text on a gray background and some questionnaires have handwritten notes in the margins Most of the questionnaires are printed in multiple columns on a page with no standard format or layout The Roper Reports documentation collection thus represents the problems inherent in the rest of the Yale Roper Collection Of the 200 Roper Reports in the Yale Collection at the time of the project 10 studies were selected across the full span of years to include any differences in format or documentation Our selection of the Roper Report data files was particularly important in the context of migrating data files The files were stored in column binary format with portions of the files coded in an archaic format based upon the IBM punch card The responses of a single case or individual interview were represented on one or more punch cards Each punch card had 80 columns and 12 rows The noncolumn binary format allowed a maximum of one character per column and a maximum of 80 variables per card The column binary format however made it possible to store more than one variable in the same column With punches allowed in each of the 12 rows the maximum number of items was increased by up to a factor of 12 This column binary format was especially popular in the 1960s and 1970s when information was stored almost exclusively on computer cards making it desirable to compress the data into as small a space as possible because it provided space for multiple answers to a single question Special instructions must be given in software programs to define this unique column and row structure Since the format is based upon old technology knowledge about its use and software input formats to read it are increasingly rare Our challenge was to find a new format that preserved the full intellectual content of the binary coding while allowing current and future technology to read the data and convert the computer card punches into meaningful values Literature Search We reviewed the library literature for this project and conducted searches of the Internet Discussion of the issues involved in archiving digital information had been well detailed in Preserving Digital Information so we limited our search to topics specific to the preservation of social science numeric data and documentation The literature search revealed much information on imaging as a preservation technique for books but little on preserving documentation for data files see Reference List We uncovered no previously published material on methods of preservation of electronic materials other than duplicate copies moved from one storage medium to another We found little information on the subject of copying data files and changing the way they are coded We searched for reports on the conversion of multiplepunched data to other formats but found nothing Nor did we find any discussion of standards for such conversions nor of the validity of various numeric data storage formats as archival media In addition we inquired of the Center for Electronic Records of the National Archives and Records Administration NARA Archival Research and Evaluation Staff to identify any standards they follow internally NARA retains numeric data in the format they are received but will transform them on request Adams 1996 There had been discussion among members of the data archive community about whether column binary was an acceptable archival format but we found no published discussion of this issue We also searched for reports on the use of proprietary formats in archiving electronic records Again we found almost no mention of numeric data in the published literature On the Web site of the ICPSR we found one discussion of the conversion of questionnairetype information from paper to electronic formats using OCR as opposed to imaging This type of information may also be found in the business records management literature which we did not review JSTOR the Journal Storage Project was making images of journal pages available to subscribers via the Web and using OCR to index the pages JSTOR 1996 This approach seemed to overcome the limitations of using either imaging or OCR technology alone We concluded that we needed to extrapolate from the more general literature on archiving textual data which emphasized the desirability of storing information in formats independent of hardware and software NARA 1990 The perils of using formats that depend on hardware and software in the case of textual data had been described by Jeff Rothenberg 1995 We had no reason to expect that numeric data would be any different During 1995 and 1996 we followed discussions on the informal list for ICPSR Official Representatives and the listserv for members of the International Association for Social Science Information Service and Technology especially on the use of PDF for storage and distribution of codebooks The discussions focused on the concern that PDF was not an acceptable archival format and would require reformatting during the lifetime of the documents ICPSR also published a discussion of this issue 1996 The Data Track The preservation projects goals for the data track were to develop and evaluate a process of migrating digital numeric information from computer tape to hardware and softwareindependent formats and to evaluate the utility of the resultant formats The process of migrating was broken down into a series of nine steps 1 Identify equipment 2 Copy files from mainframebased media to local hard disks 3 Examine the documentation 4 Define the column binary format 5 Develop standard variablenaming classifications 6 Read in the data files with SAS and SPSS 7 Identify migration formats 8 Recode data files with SAS 9 Create spread ASCII data files without recoding 1 Identify Equipment The computing environment used for the project consisted of IBM mainframes all commands were submitted as JCL batch jobs issued from a CMSbased IBM mainframe to an MVS mainframe with tape access and PCIntel Pentium 90 computers running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a Novell network 2 Copy Files We copied the column binary data files from old round reel tapes to new 3480 IBM cartridges on the Yale mainframe This was the first step in refreshing the data from the old tape medium to a more stable magnetic medium Next the data were copied from the cartridges to mainframe disk and moved via standard file transfer protocols in binary mode to the Statlab Novell server the home for the SAS program writing record keeping and output storage Once transferred to disks connected to the server each data set was checked with a simple program that read in one variablethe deck or card numberfor each observation in the original data file The number of observations for each deck number was then compared with information in the documentation Any discrepancies were noted and data files reordered from the Roper Center if errors were confirmed 3 Examine Documentation The primary document for a particular Roper Report was simply a copy of the original survey questionnaire containing the questions asked in the survey The card number and column number or numbers for locating the question in the record for each respondent were given for each question Furthermore the punch location was listed for each response option in the question All of this informationcard number column location and punch locationwas necessary for reading the original column binary data The questionnaires varied in length and in some cases multiple versions of a questionnaire were provided For example some of the surveys used a split sample either to ask different questions or to ask the same questions in different sequence Often the questions asked of the two groups in the split sample were not identical In some cases the column location and format of the different variables were identical The samples could differ in the order of items in a multipleresponse question or in using slightly different sets of items In other cases the format of the questions along with their column and row locations changed radically between samples The xray a special form of printed output supplied by the Roper Center provided a response frequency used to check the data during the migration processes Organized by card column and row the xray gave the total number of punched bits across observations for each variable in the data set The xray also provided useful information about the types of questions being answered and the complexity of reading the column binary format Because each question was usually encoded in its own column the sum of all of the responses plus any blank observations for most types of questions should add up to the total number of people in the survey If it did not then the question allowed multiple responses and would need to be read in a different manner from single response variables 4 Define Format The structure of the column binary format is illustrated in table 1 The sample question shown in the table uses two columns 47 and 48 to cover all the possible answers The full text of this question may also be seen in Appendix 1 Each card contains 12 rows numbered from top to bottom beginning with 1 at the top Punch numbers are assigned in a different way a 12 punch goes in the top row an 11 punch in the second row and the third through twelfth rows are reserved for 0 through 9 punches The 11 and 12 punches are often used for dont know no answer or not applicable responses In this example a respondent chose the values 1 2 and 4 living in poverty being abused as a child and drug abuse so punches were made in rows 4 5 and 7 as shown in the last column of the table In this question both columns 47 and 48 may have multiple punches representing the choices people were allowed to select from the list of causes of violent crime Alternatively in the noncolumn binary scheme allowing only one punch per column each possible selection would have to be coded as a separate variable and therefore as a separate column so coding of this question would take up 18 columns rather than two Table 1 Question Coding Example Roper Report 9309 Question 8Wwhich three or four things do you think

types of questions asked in the surveys was used in the construction of data set translation The classification provided a scheme for the creation of standard templates and the logic behind the variable types used in recoding the data In addition the classification made it easier to construct appropriate variable names and to ensure consistent naming across data sets Each of the variable types we defined required different variablenaming formatting and recoding procedures The four basic types of variables are regular numeric variables numeric variables with special missing values multipleresponse questions and singleresponse questions Each variable type was associated with a different template for code creation a specific form of variable names and certain projected difficulties in recoding For instance a multipleresponse variable was read in with a simple list of singlepunch variables was labeled simply with letter suffixes and was not recoded In contrast an aggregated singleresponse variable was read in with a list of singlepunch intermediate variables was labeled with intermediate number suffixes and was recoded into a final variable for the entire question Retrieving the variable type directly from the documentation provided a guide to the particular piece of program code that was necessary for inputting and recoding the variable Regular numeric variables Regular numeric variables range from 0 to 9 The values are computed by filling in each digit with the numbers in the appropriate columns For example Roper Report 9309 Question 68Y asked Do you think government lotteries produce an unwholesome gambling spirit in this country Yes1 No2 Numeric variables with special missing values These variables are identical to regular numeric variables except that there can be one or two special missing values such as dont know recorded at punch 11 andor punch 12 For example Roper Report 9309 Question 2X asked Do you feel things in this country are generally going in the right direction today or do you feel that things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track Right track1 Wrong track2 Dont knowY Multipleresponse questions Multipleresponse questions generally ask respondents to choose more than one option from a list of items as in Roper Report 9309 Question 8W illustrated in table 1 If an item was checked it was coded as 1 in the recoded data set if it was not checked it was coded as 0 Therefore for any such question there would be multiple binary variables corresponding to all of the possible responses including special missing values so that each possible response became a variable in a final recoded data set Singleresponse questions Singleresponse questions allow one and only one response per item They frequently include a special missing value at punch number 12 with several answer options between punch numbers 1 and 9 These questions require appropriate recoding for the final variable For example Roper 9309 Question 7Y asked And thinking about crime in the United States what one type of crime do you feel presents the biggest threat for you and your family today An example of multiplecolumn storage of a singleresponse question appears in table 2 Table 2 Example of multiplecolumn storage of singleresponse question lttable classquottablequotgt lttbodygt lttrgt ltthgtResponseltthgt

the three SAS column binary informats PUNCHd CBwd and ROWwd The informat PUNCHd reads a specific bit with a value of either 0 or 1 in the original data set The d value indicates which row in a column of data is to be read The informat CBwd on the other hand looks to see which one of the 10 numeric bits 0 through 9 has been punched and returns that number as a value for the column ROWwd begins reading at a userspecified bit looks to see which one of a userspecified number of bits after the first has been punched and returns a number equal to the relative location of the punched bit For instance a ROW55 informat would start reading at PUNCH5 and continue for four more bits through PUNCH9 if bit 8 was punched then the ROW55 informat would return a 4 The PUNCHd informat was the most appropriate for this project For clarification of its use refer to the sample SAS program in Appendix 2 Depending on the final form of the question the pattern of punches in a column usually had to be logically recoded later in the program from an intermediate variable to a final variable that matched the response options in the original documentation The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences SPSS is also able to read data including multipleresponse question responses from a column binary data file by using the keywords MODEMULTIPUNCH on the FILE HANDLE command An example of an SPSS program that reads a single variable from Roper Report 9309 data with SPSS is file handle test namehroperrprr9309bin recformfixed modemultipunchlrecl160 data list filetest records9 1 feddep 24 A 9 execute In this example a variable called FEDDEP is read in column 24 It has a possible Y coded as dont know requiring that SPSS read this variable as a character string see also SPSS 1988 8486 7 Identify Migration Formats We selected the following formats to test the migration process SAS system files of recoded column binary data with and without intermediate variables SAS system files with shortened integer byte lengths SAS export files of recoded column binary data ASCII files produced from recoded column binary data ASCII files of the binary data patterns in the original file called spread ASCII These formats were selected on the basis of the softwares ability to read the column binary format the availability of project staff programming expertise the transportability of output formats storage requirements size of output data sets and longterm archival implications While both SAS and SPSS software are able to read column binary data the staff members working on the project had more experience with SAS so we chose to work with that statistical package With the exception of spread ASCII data files each format we selected for testing contained completely recoded and renamed variables Storage requirements were compared on the different platforms for many of the different types of SAS data files as shown in Appendix 3 8 Recode Data Files Create intermediate variables and code missing values After reading in the data with the SAS informat statements the second step in the SAS programming process was to produce a set of ifthen statements for recoding the individual punch data the intermediate variables into final variables Each intermediate variable needed to have a column location row location variable name and SAS informat instructions specified in the input statement as seen in the example shown in table 3 The only things that changed while inputting this variable Q14 were the suffix and punch location for each intermediate variable This redundancy increased when there were more intermediate variables and especially with aggregated singleresponse variables The logical statements used for recoding the intermediate variables also contained many repetitions of the same ifthen commands Table 3 Example of variable location name and SAS informat statement lttable classquottablequotgt lttbodygt lttrgt lttdgtColumn locationlttdgt

lttablegt Since the creation of these translation programs in SAS involved a large amount of repetitive typing we created templates for both the input and recoding statements Templates were created for singleresponse variables simple and aggregated multipleresponse variables and numeric variables with special missing codes Each template included generic characters for column locations variable names and SAS informats as well as preformed logical recoding statements Furthermore the templates contained repeated lines of code for different numbers of punches or aggregate variables so that it would not be necessary to enter the redundant information for the different variables These templates considerably sped up translation code creation Once the type of the current variable had been determined the appropriate input and recode statements were copied from the template file pasted into the program code and then the key characters such as column location and variable name were replaced using a findreplace function in the text editor For example to create the code for variable Q14 a piece of the template would have been copied from the template file and pasted into the program as illustrated in table 4 The aggregated singleresponse variable template included input and recode statements for subquestions from A through Z only A and B are shown in table 4 Table 4

Then the string Q000 would be replaced with Q14 and COL1 and COL2 would be replaced with 30 and 31 respectively resulting in the final code for inputting and recoding the variables Q14A and Q14B Create macro programs to recode data files Given that we could define fairly well the different types of variables in a data set and that we could create input and recode template statements for these different variable types it was tempting to think that we would be able to write programs to automate the whole procedure That is we might imagine a program that could perform all of the operations described above with minimal effort from the human operators Although such automation may be possible in the future the irregularity of the data files presented a major obstacle Not only would an automatic translation program have to deal with some of the complexities of for example split samples with different variable types in the same column but it would also have to handle the different types of errors that occur in the original data files For example one fairly straightforward solution though quite a lot of work would have been to create a program that received some sort of variable list from a human operator set up logical conditions to create code around split samples and then write out a SAS program to translate and recode the data file More sophisticated errorchecking would have been necessary however to handle simple events such as a variable being incorrectly marked as a singleresponse type in the documentation but actually having multiple responses coded in the data Because the recoded data files needed to be of archival quality this errorchecking would have had to be quite rigorous Furthermore judgment calls would have sometimes arisen when dealing with irregularities that is should the variable be recoded differently or should the irregularity be ignored so that leaving the decision solely to a computer program was not advisable In short creating an automatic translation program to recode the data would have involved several compromises that we would not recommend Debug programs and check data Several types of errors occurred in the SAS programming typographic errors invalid informats and unexpected changes in variable types where the questionnaire did not match the data The key indicators for these problems were INVALID DATA warnings that appeared in the SAS log Once the programs ran without INVALID DATA messages the accuracy of the translation needed to be checked Complete frequencies for all of the variables in the final data set had to be compared to the frequencies in the xray For example if variable Q9 deck 1 column 30 had the following frequencies in this case PUNCH12 was recoded to the missing value of 9 lttable classquottablequotgt lttbodygt lttrgt lttdgtValuelttdgt lttdgtFrequencylttdgt lttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt then the xray for deck 1 column 30 should look like this lttable classquottablequotgt

lttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt It was necessary to check all of the variables in the final data set because one badly coded variable in the conversion job could compromise the archival integrity of the entire data set Unfortunately a random subset of variables may miss the errors If there was a mismatch between the xray and the frequencies the difference needed to be tracked down and the SAS job edited This frequency check was also the last chance to resolve ambiguities between the type of variable listed in the documentation and that shown in the xray One final point to note during this check was the maximum number of possible digits in a recoded variable If the data set was to be output in ASCII format then the number of digits in the special missing value should be equal to the number of digits in the regular values That is if a variable had values 1 through 3 then the special missing value should be 9 if it had values 1 through 12 then the special missing should be 99 and so on Save recoded data The final step in the reading and recoding process was to write to disk the resultant SAS data sets For recoded SAS to SAS export files we saved the files as SAS system files and export files with all intermediate and recoded variables and as SAS system files and export files with just the recoded variables see Appendix 3 For recoded SAS to ASCII once the SAS data set had been completely debugged and doublechecked PUT statements could be written to create an ASCII version of the recoded data see Appendix 2 The simplest way to write these PUT statements was to copy the INPUT statements from the original job or from the recoding statements strip off the column binary informat information and manually type in the new column locations for each variable These PUT statements had two advantages unlike automatic translation programs they created ASCII data files with minimum wasted space and the PUT statement itself could be distributed as a data dictionary For the first data set translated an ASCII version of the recoded SAS data set was created using an automatic translation program called DBMSCOPY version 510 However this ASCII data set was not satisfactory Although the translation program automatically created a data dictionary based on the variable names in the SAS data set the ASCII data set was not compact The translation program seemed to be incapable of concatenating one variables width of columns against the previous variables columns so that there would be no wasted space within the flat data set Instead the program inserted multiple spaces between each variable which allowed a differing number of characters within each variable but also inserted approximately 10 ASCII space characters between each variable Because of the enormously increased storage requirements this insertion causes this approach to creating ASCII data files was abandoned and program code for creating compact ASCII data files was written in SAS 9 Create Spread ASCII Data Files The original column binary data files did not necessarily have to be recoded during the translation process Another possible method of translation was simply to convert or spread the column binary into ASCII data Spread ASCII data files keep the binary structure of the column binary data but encode each 0 or 1 as an ASCII character For example the following column in the original data each 0 or 1 is one bit 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 would become 000010000000 in the spread version While this example uses a singleresponse variable multipleresponse questions may have more than one bit with a value of 1 in the column To create a spread version of the data each bit or punch in the column binary file could be read via SAS in our case as an individual variable each variable was then written to a new ASCII data set Because the punches in the column binary data were rectangular and because the variables being written out did not have to be meaningfully recoded the SAS code itself was largely a simple iteration over columns and rows of INPUT and PUT statements The iterative nature of the SAS program suggested that a macro program could be written to automate the creation of SAS code A simple C program was written based on this iteration over columns and rows After prompting the user for unique informationthe name of the SAS program file to be created the name of the data set to be created the name and path of the column binary file and the number of decks and record length LRECL of the original datathe C program simply looped over columns and rows The program passed through the loop twice In the first pass the program created an INPUT statement that would read in each punch looping over columns and rows as a new variable The second pass created a PUT statement in which each new variable would be written to an ASCII file The C program was not itself reading or writing the data files instead it created many repetitive lines of SAS code to read and write the data files see Appendix 4 Each card of column binary data was translated to a line of ASCII data Since each card contained 960 data points 80 columns by 12 rows each line of ASCII data contained 960 characters The spread ASCII data set expanded about 600 percent from the original size It took about 15 minutes to create the spread ASCII data on the IBM PC network including all steps from running the C program to writing out the ASCII data We investigated the formats currently distributed by the Roper Center and the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill IRSS to determine their utility over time and to evaluate them in light of our findings Both distributors were producing what we call the hybrid spread ASCII data files from the original column binary files These files are produced by horizontally concatenating the data into a new format The first 80 columns of the data set contained the 80 columns of the original file however any binary encoding of variables with multiplepunch coding was converted to ASCII The entire file was then converted to spread ASCII and the resultant data were appended to the end of the record Users could access the nonbinary data in the original column locations if they needed to access data that were originally punched in the binary mode they could read those data from the spread ASCII portion of the record Data dictionaries were produced that mapped the location of variables from both the original 80 columns and the spread ASCII portion of the record We obtained sample programs from IRSS to help us evaluate these hybrid spread file formats We also acquired sample data files from IRSS and the Roper Center with their enhanced data dictionaries to evaluate their utility We then adapted a SAS program from IRSS to produce the data map showing the new column locations of the data items This data map allowed for quick translation from the columnbyrow information necessary to read column binary data to the columnonly information necessary to read the spread ASCII data A note at the top of the data map showed the order of punches in the spread ASCII data For example for a response located at column 56 row 1 in the original data set the data map showed the same responses location as column 661 in the ASCII data set a response at column 56 row 5 would be located at column 665 and a response at column 56 row Y12 would be located at column 672 see Appendix 5 The Documentation Track Several options were available for digitizing the documentation including image scanning OCR combinations of image and text PDF format and text encoding The initial part of the project included identifying formats to test and set up the scanning workstation Complete documentation for each file was scanned including the questionnaires xrays frequency counts data maps and other metadata whenever available Software and Equipment The scanner used was a HewlettPackard ScanJet 4c with a document feeder and SCSI connection to an IBM 750P90 PC All files were stored on an external SCSI Iomega Jaz drive For a major scanning project a fast machine with 32 MB of memory was required Also a PCI bus SCSI card speeded up transfer rates from the scanner to the computer An automatic document feeder reduced the labor by automating the page turning Such laborsaving devices are costeffective because scanning operations tend to absorb a lot of resources and to constrain work on other major tasks while the scanning is in progress Scanners differ in speed and for a given scanner speed varies with the desired scanning resolution Speed could be an important factor in making a purchasing decision for a major project as it can have a considerable impact on labor costs For the HP 4c the time it takes to scan a page varied with the desired resolution as indicated below lttable classquottablequotgt lttbodygt lttrgt lttdgtDesired Resolutionlttdgt

lttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt TextBridge Pro Optical Character Recognition We first scanned the documentation for one Roper Report using the OCR software TextBridge Pro We reviewed alternative OCR software products and finding no significant benefits to using one over another chose a package with which the staff had experience Initial evaluation of the OCR output showed that there were significant numbers of errors in the resultant ASCII text We tested various resolutions and documented time taken for setup and for scanning optimum settings range of file sizes quality of proofing summaries and procedures to follow The questionnaires we scanned with the TextBridge Pro software had an unacceptable rate of character recognition including incorrect location information necessary for manipulating the accompanying data files Handwritten notes were completely lost and the editing costs of reviewing the output and changing all errors would have been prohibitive This format did not present us with an adequate archival solution to preserving the textual material so no further documentation was scanned using this process TextBridge Pro does not work well with poor originals determining optimum scanning settings was very timeconsuming and sometimes impossible compression formats did not give good results and raw ASCII format required timeconsuming reformatting see Appendix 6 for a photocopy of a page from Roper Report 9309 Question 10 and for the TextBridge Pro sample output of the same question Document condition When used with printed clean originals OCR is very accurate even when the font size is small and can replicate the formatting of the original document For example TextBridge Pro is capable of producing lowresolution images and exporting both images and text to a word processing document that retains the format of the original printed page However there are far more problems with this process when the quality of the original is anything less than perfect as in our case TextBridge has a particular problem with italics and underlining even with good quality originals TextBridge Pro also does not work well with columns and has some difficulty recognizing tables and columns in originals let alone poor photocopies This problem gets much worse when some of the entries in some of the table cells are blank because the columns get shifted cleaning up the resulting output files becomes a major undertaking Scanner settings TextBridge Pro allows considerable control over the way in which the document is scanned in as an image For some settings this task can be delegated to TextBridge Pro by setting options to automatic in other words TextBridge Pro tries to figure out what works as it scans the page But TextBridge Pro does not always make these determinations successfully Nor are photocopies ideal for scanning particularly if not all of the characters are completely clear and if not all of the pages are of the same lightnessdarkness Successful recognition requires changing the settings periodically to account for the varying quality of the photocopies Two outcomes are possible if the settings are not optimal in some cases the program is unsuccessful in recognizing text that is legible in the original in others it gives the frustratingly cryptic error page too complex for selected mode We finally became convinced that there was no simple system for setting these options In the worst case it was a frustrating process of trial and error Too dark a setting meant that the program tried to decipher each small dot on the page as though it were part of a character As a result it was not possible to use 600600 resolution in cases where originals were speckled Likewise selecting the text only option for the original page format forced the program to try to convert everything on the page into text including imperfections in the image or dark binding patches On the other hand sometimes the auto brightness setting scans were so light that no text was recognized on the page In some cases we spent hours trying to correct the settings manually Proofing text TextBridge Pro provides an optional feature that facilitates the correction of recognition errors When text is scanned it is possible to save proofing text This information is used by special modules that are installed into WordPerfect or Word and are implemented as macros If the relevant module is installed and the document opened in the word processor all words are highlighted that TextBridge Pro was unsure it recognized The color of the highlighted word indicates the confidence TextBridge Pro has in its accuracy TextBridge Pro can be taught to recognize particular fonts with a higher degree of accuracy through a period of training during which it asks the user to help it recognize ambiguous characters We did not use this feature extensively Our limited experience showed it does increase the likelihood of successful recognition if originals were poor but not truly awful The effort is only worthwhile if the same types of fonts will be encountered often which was not the case with the Roper Reports documentation Final format The available formats into which the output text can be saved depends on the options selected There are a very large number of possible word processor text and spreadsheet formats However if save proofing text is selected then the file can be saved in only Word or WordPerfect format Similarly if reconstitute text is selected only file formats that support fairly complex formatting are available When formatting text with the reconstitute text option TextBridge Pro will use some of the new style features of WordPerfect or Word in the new document This can make subsequent editing cumbersome Though the styles themselves can be edited an alternative is to save in a file format that supports the text features that are being reconstituted but does not support styles In this way the formatting will appear as regular tabs font changes and so forth that can be directly edited The editing of ASCII text to recreate the format of the original is a major undertaking and the time required to reformat each document is extensive We found that getting pagination to match the original is particularly difficult The scanned images produced by TextBridge Pro can be stored in CCITT3 a compression standard for later processing but the results from the subsequent processing of these images were not as good as those obtained from processing the images directly from the scanner We decided that using these compression formats would not give usable results PDF Files from Adobe Capture The next step in the documentation portion of the project was to produce documents in the portable document format PDF used by Adobe Acrobat a widely accepted de facto standard for encoding electronic documents The viewing software provided by Adobe allows for reading and searching the text viewing the structure of a document and printing highquality hard copy PDF documents provided clear accurate reproductions of the questionnaires The Adobe Capture software produced an interim ASCII text file that could be edited to improve text searching An example of a viewing screen may be found at the end of Appendix 6 Basic structure of Acrobat files Adobe Acrobat files distinguished by the PDF suffix on the file names can contain both text and image information from the original document There are different types of PDF files containing different kinds of information normal PDF imageonly PDF and imagetext PDF Normal PDF files by default display the text information derived from the OCR process Where the text information is unknown when there is a nontext picture on the page or there were difficulties in the OCR process a normal PDF file will insert the original image into that space on the display page Imageonly PDF files are in effect paginated pictures of the original pages Like tagged image file format TIFF files the text in these images is not searchable Like imageonly files imagetext PDF files show the image of the original pages but also contain searchable text The imagetext files were chosen as the most appropriate for this project The user would see a faithful reproduction of the original documentation complete with handwritten notes with the PDF browser but could also search for specific text within the document If text in the search function looked suspicious a user could view the original image In comparison files produced by OCR programs contain only the text information with no way to doublecheck the text against the image of the original Adobe Acrobat Capture procedures When scanning the document with the Capture software a set of pages was scanned in sequence Each page was stored as a separate TIFF file with the filenames numbered sequentially For example a 40page document produced 40 TIFF files named page01 page02 through page40 These original image files in TIFF format were stored separately from the final reformatted PDF documents providing a set of image files for digital storage When translating the images into editable text the TIFF files were concatenated into a single document during the OCR scanning process Acrobat Capture analyzed the page layout and grouped text into regions It then identified characters and grouped them into words The words were looked up in the Acrobat dictionary which can be customized and spelling suspects noted Fonts were analyzed and font suspects identified The interim text layer of the final PDF file contains no image data and can be edited with the Capture Reviewer so that the text matches the original document as closely as possible During the OCR process each word was assigned a confidence rating representing the softwares estimate of its OCR accuracy For the searchable text of the final PDF file to be as accurate as possible many OCR errors were corrected by editing the interim files Fortunately the program used to edit interim files Acrobat Capture Reviewer would highlight words whose confidence levels fell below a certain threshold or that were not included in a dictionary file The majority of unrecognized words could be easily spotted and corrected to match the original document Although the Reviewer software allows one to change fonts and other formatting options the only editing necessary for the project was in the content of the words used for searching purposes words used to locate terms in question text and variable coding Since the user would see only the image reproduction of the original the underlying ASCII text need to be reformatted as a visual reproduction of the original Once the document was edited it was then saved in the imagetext PDF format Time and storage requirements of PDF files The total time required to process a 39page document was approximately four hours from scanning to saving the final PDF The scanning itself took 30 minutes the OCR process took 20 minutes and editing the resulting file took 3 hours 15 minutes The storage space required for this document is shown in table 5 Table 5 Example of storage space

split samples had dual documentation The time taken for the scanning process using a document feeder ranged from 5 to 30 minutes The OCR software took between 15 and 35 minutes to process each document The time taken to edit each document varied widely from one to eightandahalf hours The time it took to complete a single document depended largely on the quality of the original Features such as background shadows crooked lines of text compressed fonts jagged edges on letters and handwriting increased both the time it took the OCR software to process the page and more importantly the time it took to edit or insert accurate searchable text In some cases blocks of text were so unrecognizable that whole questions needed to be typed in as hidden search text Additional time was required for errorchecking Problems encountered in text recognition and editing of PDF files Although Adobe Acrobat Preview highlights most words with low confidence levels some forms of errors are not so easily detected during the editing phase A word was not recognized as a block of text by Capture software during the OCR process This means that instead of a text form of the word the document included simply a bitmapped image of the word from the original page Such an image of course would not be searchable Fortunately these image blocks had some telltale signs First they appeared to be in a font that was usually quite different from the fonts assigned to the recognized words Also they were usually surrounded by a fine gray or blue box After some experience an editor could quickly spot the image boxes as the page was being read Although these image boxes could not be changed to text a Reviewer command can be used to insert hidden search text underneath them A later search would highlight the image as if it were a normal word A word was recognized as another valid English word In this case the confidence level for the word might be quite high and the word would not normally be highlighted For instance if a falsely recognized word was assigned a confidence level of 97 percent and Preview was set to highlight words at 95 percent or below then the wrong word would not be highlighted These words can be highlighted by raising the threshold setting although at high levels 98 percent or 99 percent virtually every word in the document would be highlighted The only practical way to discover these errors was for an editor to read through the document carefully Once errors were spotted the correct words would be inserted In rare cases a line of text could be skipped in the OCR process Again nothing would be highlighted but fortunately there would be obvious gaps in the text block where the line was skipped A careful reading of the document would reveal these gaps As a corrective a new block of text could be created to overlay the gap The correct text could then be typed in for the purpose of future searches In each of these cases an attentive editor must catch the OCR error and make appropriate changes to the text to verify accurate search and retrieval We did not edit enough documents to estimate the average time needed for cleaning a complete document Future projects will need to budget extensive editing costs HTML and SGMLXML Markedup Files Conversion of scanned text to hypertext markup language HTML format would provide a more readily accessible browsing format However the text of each document would need to be fully edited and formatted As indicated above the ASCII output from the OCR technology we used could not provide us with text clean enough to use in HTML Moving text into documents adhering to the standard general markup languageextensible markup language SGMLXML is the most laborintensive but also the most dynamic alternative for text applications SGMLXML tagging allows customized and robust access to specific pieces of the documentation such as question text and variable location information SGMLXML Document Type Definitions maintain the integrity of document content and structure and also define the relationships among the elements The emerging social science documentation standard for both formatting and content the Data Documentation Initiative DDI Document Type Definition DTD provides standard elements developed specifically for social science numeric resources The standard adheres to our requirement that text be stored in a systemindependent nonproprietary format Furthermore this standard developed by representatives from the international social science research community is intended to fill the need for a structured codebook standard that will serve as an interchange format and permit the development of new Web applications However this format requires that the text be fully edited and the components of the documentation tagged and funding for this work was not included in the budget for this project Findings and Recommendations Upon completing the steps defined in both the data and documentation tracks we carefully examined the processes of migrating hardware and softwaredependent formats to independent formats We also evaluated the formats in relation to their utility and ease of use over time In both the data migration and the documentation migration processes it was imperative that the original content be preserved Migration that included recoding the content of the data files changing the character or numeric equivalents in a data file proved to be laborintensive and errorprone and produced unacceptable changes to the original content of the data Editing the text output from the scanning process proved to be the same errorprone timeconsuming and incomplete Therefore recoding as a part of migration is not recommended However simply copying a file in its original format from medium to medium refreshing is not enough Softwaredependent data file formats such as the original column binary files examined in the project cannot be read without specific software routines If standard software packages do not offer those specific routines in the future translation programs that emulate the softwares reading of the column binary format could provide a solution However these emulation programs will themselves require migration strategies over time We offer another alternative for the column binary format convert the data out of the column binary format into ASCII without changing the coded values of the files The spread ASCII format meets the criterion of software independence while simultaneously preserving the original content of the data set It does however require a filebyfile migration strategy that would be timeconsuming for a large collection of files Finding a parallel solution for the documentation files is not possible at this time We can not accurately generate characterbycharacter equivalents of the paper records We can however scan the paper into digital representations that could be used in future character recognition technologies The Adobe PDF imagetext format does provide an interim solution by producing digital versions of the image and limited ASCII representation of the text However the types of documentation files produced by the Adobe process are software dependent If software packages move away from the format used to store the imagetext files translators will be necessary to search print and display the files We therefore recommend archiving the images of the printed pages in both nonproprietary TIFF format and PDF imagetext format User Evaluation We asked faculty and graduate students to make an informal review of the findings and sample output from the project All our evaluators had previous experience using data files from the Yale Roper Collection Regarding the data conversions they expressed relief at not having to use column binary input statements to read the data files They had no difficulty in using the chart that mapped column binary to ASCII in order to locate variables in the spread ASCII version of the data files once it was explained that each variable mapped directly to a 12column equivalent and instructions were given for finding single and multiplepunch locations As for the documentation track faculty and student reviewers found viewing and browsing PDF format files acceptable Since most users had accessed PDF files on the Web they seemed comfortable moving from the Internet browser to the Adobe Reader to locate question text and variable location information This may not be the case with inexperienced users These users were eager to have more questionnaire texts available for browsing and searching The lack of a large sample collection of questionnaires did not allow evaluation of question text searching on a large scale Findings about Data Conversion Column binary into SAS and SPSS As long as software packages can read the SAS and SPSS export formats recoding the column binary format into SAS and SPSS export files is an attractive option These file formats can be used easily are transportable to multiple operating systems and equipment configurations and can be transformed into other softwarespecific formats They do however have a number of drawbacks First the original data file must be recoded a process that is lengthy and potentially errorprone and one that places great reliance on the person doing the translation If that person does not adequately check for errors annotate the documentation for irregular variables or properly recode the original patterns of punches the translated data set becomes inconsistent with the original Also some irregularities in the original data set which may be meaningful in the analysis of the data can become lost when the data set is cleaned up For instance the original documentation might indicate that a question has four possible responses PUNCH1 through PUNCH3 for a rating scale and PUNCH12 for a dont know response On examination of the xray though it is discovered that about 200 people had their responses coded as PUNCH11 not PUNCH12 A decision must be made will those PUNCH11 observations be given the same special missing value code as that for PUNCH12 This solution will put the responses in the data set into accordance with the documentation by assuming that the strange punches were simply due to errors in data entry On the other hand the strange punches could have been intentionally entered to mark out those observations for special reasons that are not listed in the documentation In this case it would be better to give the PUNCH11 observations a special missing value different from that for PUNCH12 Once the recoding is done future researchers will be unable to recreate the original data set with its irregularities Second this process of reading recoding and cleaning data files to produce SAS or SPSS system files and export files is very timeconsuming For example it took 20 hours of work to write debug and doublecheck a SAS program to recode the data set for Roper Report 9209 which includes a split sample and a variety of variable types Assuming a wage of 15 an hour for an experienced SAS programmer we would expect a cost of approximately 600 per data set for a complete job of data recoding This estimate of course does not include the cost of consultations with data archivists about the recoding of particular variables or the cost of rewriting documentation to reflect the new format of the data set Third data files stored in SAS and SPSS and other statistical software formats require proprietary software to read the information Although there has been an increase in programs that can read and transfer data files from one program and one version of a program to another there is no guarantee that programs for specific versions of software will be available in the future US Census data from the 1970s were produced in compressed format called Dualabs that relied on custom programs and can no longer be read on most of todays computing platforms Such system and softwaredependent formats require expensive migration strategies to move them to future computing technologies Spread ASCII format If an archival standard is defined as a noncolumn binary nonproprietary format that faithfully reproduces the content of the original files only the spread ASCII format meets these conditions This spread format however is at least 600 percent larger than the original file and requires converting the original column binary structure It also requires producing additional documentation since each punch listed in the original documentation must be assigned a new column location in the spread ASCII data We recommend that each file be converted to a standard spread ASCII format so that a single conversion map may be used for all the data files see Appendix 5 for an example from this project Producing such an ASCII data set has several advantages Information is not lost from the original data set because the pattern of 0s and 1s remains conceptually the same across data files It is unnecessary for a data translator to interpose herself between the original data and the final user However the spread ASCII format is not perfect The storage requirements for spread ASCII data are on a par with the size requirements for a SAS data set containing both recoded and intermediate variables For the overhead in storage cost the SAS data set at least provides internally referenced variable names and meaningful variable values The size of the spread ASCII data becomes even more apparent when it is contrasted with the size of a recoded ASCII data set In a recoded data set each unused bit can be left out of the final data particular bits in a column need not even be input if they contain no values for the variable and columns without variables may also be skipped In contrast in the spread ASCII data each bit is input and translated to a character whether it is used or not The spread ASCII format requires that users must know how the variables particularly the multipleresponse variables relate to the 12column equivalent A spread ASCII data set is not as easily used as a fully recoded one after all recoding the 0s and 1s into usable variable values will fall to the end user with ASCII data just as it currently does with column binary data Finally each punch listed in the original documentation must be assigned a new column location in the spread ASCII data Users must refer to an additional piece of documentation the ASCII data map to locate data of interest and this extra step inevitably creates some initial confusion Hybrid spread ASCII The hybrid spread ASCII format distributed by the Roper Center and the Institute for Research in Social Science at University of North Carolina offers another alternative The original data are stored in column binary format in the first horizontal layer of the file This format preserves the original structure of the data file in the first part of a new record A second horizontal layer of converted data in spread ASCII format is added to the new record The primary advantage of this hybrid spread ASCII data file format is that users can access the nonbinary portions of the original data file in their original column locations as indicated on the questionnaires However users have to know whether the question and variables of interest were coded in the binary format in order to determine whether to read the first part of the record or the second The ASCII codes in the first horizontal layer are readable but any binary coding in that first horizontal layer are not since the binary coding is converted to ASCII to avoid problems while reading the data with statistical software If users want to read data that were coded in binary in the original file they can read the spread ASCII version of multiplepunched equivalents in the second horizontal layer without having to learn the column binary input statements to read the data We chose to produce converted ASCII files that did not have this twopart structure To use the spread ASCII data files we constructed users first determine the original column location of a particular variable from the questionnaire and then use a simple data map to locate the column location in the new spread ASCII file see Appendix 5 Original column binary format The column binary format itself turned out to be more attractive as a longterm archival standard than we had anticipated It conserves space it preserves the original coding of data and matches the column location information in the documentation it can be transferred among computers in standard binary and it can be read by standard statistical packages on all of the platforms we used in testing Unfortunately it is difficult to locate and decipher information about how to read column binary data with SAS and SPSS as the latest manuals for PC versions of the software no longer contain supporting information about this format This lack of documentation support indicates the possibility that the input formats will not be offered in subsequent software versions On the other hand as long as the format exists there seems to be some level of commitment to support it As stated in the SAS Language Reference text because multipunched decks and cardimage data sets remain in existence the SAS System provides informats for reading columnbinary data SAS 1990 389 If the column binary format is refreshed onto new media and preserved only in its original form we recommend that sample programs for reading the data with standard statistical packages or a standalone translation program be included in the collection of supporting files But even with these supplemental programs accessing and converting the files will continue to present significant challenges to researchers Given these considerations we do not recommend this format over the spread ASCII alternative Findings about Documentation Conversion The OCR output files from TextBridge Pro did not provide us with an adequate means for archiving the textual material The questionnaires we scanned had an unacceptable rate of character recognition including incorrect location information necessary for manipulating the accompanying data files Handwritten notes were completely lost Although the format allowed for searching of a particular text that was successfully recognized the amount of editing required to produce a legible version of the original review the output and correct all errors was found to be prohibitive Subsequent viewing was poor without the formatting capabilities of proprietary word processing software The PDF format provided solutions to some of the documentation distribution and preservation problems we faced but it did not meet all of our needs For one thing the format does not go far enough in providing internal structure for the manipulation output and analysis of the metadata Like a tagged MARC record in an online public access catalog fulltext documentation for numeric data requires specific content tagging to allow search retrieval manipulation and reformatting of individual sections of the information Another drawback is that PDF files are produced and stored in a format that may be difficult to read and search in the future The PDF format although a published standard depends on proprietary software that may not be available in future computing environments A similar problem can be seen with dBase data files that are rapidly becoming outmoded causing major problems with large collections of CDROM products distributed by the US government We see increasing numbers of PDF documents distributed on the Internet and the format will be used by ICPSR for the distribution of machinereadable documentation to its member institutions So given the large number of PDF files in distribution software for conversion will most likely be developed over time However the current popularity of the PDF format does not guarantee that software to read it will continue to be available throughout the future of technological evolution The TIFF graphic image file format is useful for viewing and for distribution on the Web and as an intermediate archival format allowing storage of files until they can be processed in the future using more advanced OCR technology Even though this format does not allow text searching taggingmark up or editing it moves the endangered material into digital format ICPSR has decided to retain such digital images of its printed documentation collection for reprocessing as OCR technology evolves It is our recommendation that both PDFAdobe Capture edited output and scanned image files be produced and archived The PDFAdobe imagetext files allow searching and viewing of text in original formatting The scanned image files can be archived for future character recognition and enhancement We also want to emphasize the importance of the longterm development of tagged documentation using the DDI format This is by far the most desirable format albeit one that is difficult to produce from printed documentation given the inadequacy of OCR technology and the costs of subsequent editing We urge future producers and distributors of numeric data to help develop and adhere to standard system independent documentation Recommendations to Data Producers Design affects maintenance costs and longterm preservation Producers of statistical data files need to be cognizant of preservation strategies and the importance of systemindependent formats that can be migrated through generations of media and technological applications In this project we had significant problems with the column binary format of the data Had longterm maintenance plans been considered and the costs of migration been taken into consideration the creators of the data format might not have chosen the column binary format At the time however it was the most compact format to use and standard software could then be adapted to the format One thing is very clear data producers would be advised and should be persuaded to take longterm maintenance and preservation considerations into account as they create data files and as they design valueadded systems Our experience shows that the most simple format is the best longterm format the flat ASCII data file We would urge producers to provide columndelimited ASCII files accompanied by complete machinereadable documentation in nonproprietary and nonplatformspecific formats Programming statements also known as control cards for SAS and SPSS are also highly recommended so that users can convert the raw data into system files The control card files can be modified for later versions of statistical software and used for other programming applications and indexing In accordance with emerging standards for resource discovery data files should contain a standard electronic header or be accompanied by machinereadable metadata identification information This information should include complete citations to all the parts of a particular study data files documentation control card files and so forth and serve as a studylevel record of contents and structure Metadata standards Not only must standards be considered for the structure of the numeric data files but the metadatainformation describing the datamust also conform to content and format standards for current use and for longterm preservation applications Content standards require common elements or a common set of containers that hold specific types of information Standards for coding variables should be followed so that linkages and crossstudy analysis are enhanced and common thesauri for searching and mining data collections also need to be produced As for format standards metadata should be produced in systemindependent formats that provide standard structures for the common elements and coding schemes These format standards should provide consistent tagging of elements that can be mapped to resource discovery and viewing software and to statistical analysis and database systems For most social science data files machinereadable documentation should be supplied in ASCII format that conforms to standard guidelines for both content and format With some very large surveys using complex survey instruments files in this ASCII format may be so big that complex structures in nonproprietary format need to be developed to reduce storage requirements If paper documentation is distributed it should be produced using highquality duplication techniques with simple fonts no underlining no handwritten notations and plenty of white space Of particular interest is the Data Documentation Initiative DDI DTD Document Type Definition in XML which is a developing standard for documentation describing numeric databases It provides both content and format standards for creating digitized documentation in XML Data producers in the United States Canada and Europe will be testing the DTD as part of their documentation production process Data archives will be converting their digitized documentation into this format and some will be scanning paper documentation and tagging the content with the DDI Complex statistical systems We must also be concerned about the longterm preservation plans for complex systems As we see more efforts to integrate data and documentation within linked systems we see a growing tension between access and preservation Complex database management systems such as ORACLE or SQL present us with more complex questions What parts of the system need to be preserved to save the content of the information as well as its integrity Will snapshots of the system provide future users with enough information to simulate access as we see it today Is the content usable outside the context of the system These are the database preservation challenges of the future Glossary ASCIIAmerican Standard Code for Information Interchange A character encoding scheme used by many computers The ASCII standard uses 7 of the 8 bits that make up a byte to define the codes for 128 characters Example in ASCII the number seven is a treated as a character and is encoded as 00010111 Because a byte can have a total of 256 possible values there are an additional 128 possible characters that can be encoded into a byte but there is no formal ASCII standard for those additional 128 characters Most IBMcompatible personal computers do use an IBM extended character set that includes international characters line and box drawing characters Greek letters and mathematical symbols CA programming language CBwdInstructions that the SAS System uses to read standard numeric values from columnbinary files translating the data into standard binary format The w value specifies the width of the variable usually 8 but has a range between 1 and 32 The d value specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the numeric value cardAlso known as deck a physical record of data A survey may have multiple cards for each respondent all cards together comprising a logical record Based on the IBM punch cards of 80column length caseThe unit of analysis in a particular data file Can be an individual respondent to a questionnaire a customer or an industry In the Roper Reports each case is an interview respondent codebookDescription of the organization and content of a data file Contains the code ranges and the code meanings needed to interpret the data file column binaryA code originally used with punched cards in which successive bits are represented by the presence or absence of punches in contiguous positions in columns Using this method responses to more than one question can be stored in a single column data dictionaryA file part of a file or part of a printed codebook containing information about a data file including the name of the element its format location and size Data Documentation Initiative DDIAn international committee sponsored by ICPSR that is developing a new metadata standard for social science documentation This standard developed by representatives from the international social science research community is intended to fill the need for a structured codebook standard that will serve as an interchange format and permit the development of new Web applications The Document Type Definition DTD for the DDI standard is written in XML Extensible Markup Language and is available at httpwwwicpsrumicheduDDIhttpsddiallianceorg deckAlso known as card a logical record of data A survey may have multiple cards for each respondent all cards together comprising a logical record Based on the IBM punch cards of 80column length documentationInformation that accompanies a data file describing the condition of the data the creation of the file the location and size of variables in the

of the same software package HTMLHyperText Markup Language ICPSRInteruniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research informatThe instructions that specify how SAS reads the numbers and characters in a data file intermediate variableA variable used when recoding data to input information from individual punches in multipunch data Sets of intermediate variables are then recoded to produce final variables logical recordA complete unit of data for a particular unit of analysis in this project a single respondent Multiple physical records called cards or decks may make up a logical record missing valueA value code that indicates no data are present for a variable for a particular case To be distinguished from nonresponse values respondent refused to answer or was not asked the question and from invalid responses the response did not have a valid value code equivalent Nonresponses and invalid responses may or may not have value categories provided in the questionnaire and may be treated differently from true missing data during analysis multipunchedA way of recording data originally used with punched cards in which successive bits are represented by the presence or absence of punches in contiguous positions in columns Using this method responses to more than one question can be stored in a single column OCROptical character recognition PDFPortable Document Format a published standard format developed by Adobe Systems accessed with proprietary software punch cardA paper medium used for recording computerreadable data The card is punched by a special machine called a keypunch that works like a typewriter except that it punches holes in cards instead of typing characters on paper The punch cards are then processed with a card reader that transfers the punched information to a computerreadable digital format PUNCHdInstructions that the SAS system uses to read standard numeric values from column binary files The d value specifies which row in a card column to read Valid values for the d value are 1 through 12 questionnaireThe set of questions asked in a survey In the Yale Roper Collection the questionnaire with columns and codes written next to the question may substitute for a codebook recodeChanging the value code of a variable from one value to another For example changing 0 and 1 values in column binary data files to value ranges of 0 through 12 Also known as data transformation respondentIn survey research the person responding to the survey questions ROWwdInstructions that the SAS system uses to read a columnbinary field down a card column The w value specifies the row where the field begins with a range between 1 and 12 The d value specifies the length in rows of the field Valid values for d are 1 through 25 with the default value of 1 The informat assigns the relative position of the punch in the field range to a numeric variable SASSet of proprietary computer programs used for analysis of social science statistical data No longer an acronym originally stood for Statistical Analysis System SGMLStandard General MarkUp Language SPSSStatistical Package for the Social Sciences Set of proprietary computer programs used for analysis of social science statistical data singlepunchA single response coded in a column split sampleA method of data collection in which one group of

column of a record to a separate column for each response system fileA data file or collection of data files specifically formatted for a particular software package may not be readable by other software packages TIFFTagged Image File Format valuesThe numeric or character equivalents for a particular variable in a data file variableAn item in a data file to which a value has been assigned A data file contains the values of certain variables measured for a set of cases In the Roper Report data files variables are responses to questions or parts of questions from each person interviewed XMLExtensible Markup Language XML is a data format for structured document interchange on the Web xrayA form of output that is organized by card column and row each bit has its own unique location within this framework The total number of punched bits across all observations is recorded for each location in the data set This sum often provides a response frequency for individual response

is credited with changing the nature of scholarship and teaching but perceptions of the benefits of the technology vary widely from person to person Many librarians have embraced the technology as the best vehicle for expanding access to information resources while also broadening the roles and responsibilities of the traditional library The perceptions of scholars in the humanities and related social sciences are far more varied Some scholars warmly endorse the librarians focus on electronic resources because they want better access to collections at remote sites But other scholars express concern that funds presently used to purchase and preserve books and journals will be diverted to building network infrastructure and purchasing electronic resources To understand how technology is changing the nature of scholarship and teaching the American Council of Learned Societies ACLS and the Council on Library and Information Resources CLIR joined forces to establish five task forces that examined these questions by looking at the special requirements posed by different types of information resources The deliberations of these task forces are detailed in this report Little here will come as a great surprise to either the library or scholarly communities The interests and enthusiasms of the task force members vary based on their beliefs about what the future holds for them and their professions What scholars want from librarians of the future is not so different from what they have wanted all alongthe full range of resources they need to do their work While they may sympathize with the financial decisions that plague librarians they do not focus on them Certainly there is no single scholarly perspective that libraries can use as a guiding principle From the discussions we have extracted all of the recommendations that were proposed by individual task force members While some clear priorities emerged the groups did not always attempt to reach consensus on the various recommendations nor to place them in priority order Many of the ideas we believe will be pursued by professional associations and scholarly societies We hope these recommendations will be discussed and adopted wherever appropriate As for our two organizations we hope to facilitate librarians and scholars continuing discussions to help guide the development of digital library resources to be made available for scholarship and teaching And we would hope to assist the smaller scholarly societies make the transition to electronic publishing We believe such partnerships between libraries and scholarly societies benefit both organizations The recommendations of the task forces will prove helpful to both ACLS and CLIR as we continue to address these issues We are grateful to the Gladys Krible Delmas Foundation for funding these preliminary discussions Our hope is that many librarians faculty members and university officers will find information here that will help them make better decisions on local campuses John DArms President American Council of Learned Societies Deanna B Marcum President Council on Library and Information Resources Executive Summary The American Council of Learned Societies and the Council on Library and Information Resources appointed 36 scholars librarians and leaders of various academic enterprises to five task forces to consider changes in the process of scholarship and instruction that will result from the use of digital technology and to make recommendations to ensure that libraries continue to serve the research needs of scholars The task forces met in the 19971998 academic year From a large number of detailed recommendations there emerged five areas of concern for the future of research libraries 1 Despite predictions of the collapse of research libraries because of the widespread availability of information on the World Wide Web in fact the roles and responsibilities of libraries and librarians have expanded because of the Web While libraries are proud of their accomplishments scholars are concerned about the tendency of library collections to grow more similar in content under fiscal pressure They believe that research libraries should amass collections of deep relevance in a coordinated fashion encompassing information resources in both digital and traditional formats Librarians agree adding a requirement of costeffective coordination of effort among research institutions 2 There is a good and expanding system for providing intellectual access to information both in libraries and on the Web Institutions must invest fiscal and other resources to make unique or special collections more broadly accessible Faculty are urged to make increased use of primary source materials to develop critical thinking in students 3 Copyright and management of intellectual property are key issues Scholars and librarians on the task force believe that institutions and learned societies favor the rights of users over those of the creators of copyrightable material Library organizations and learned societies should explore the possibilities of exploiting and managing intellectual property to yield greater benefits to the scholarly communities 4 Institutions of higher education and research should place more emphasis on training and support for faculty use of information and instructional technologies Research libraries and learned societies should endeavor to specify improvements in the system of scholarly communication and to provide models designed to make more scholarly materials accessible to scholars everywhere 5 The task forces believe that there is too little sharing of information to enable the scholarly community to participate in the philosophical and policy issues arising from the use of information technology in research and teaching as well as in libraries They urge CLIR and ACLS to improve communications with individual institutions and with each learned society to close the gap of understanding and to encourage broader participation in policy setting Synthesis of Proceedings In late fall 1997 Stanley Katz then president of the ACLS and Deanna B Marcum president of CLIR surveyed the state of affairs in scholarship college and university teaching and research librarianship They concluded that sufficient experience had been amassed in the use of digital methods and sources by scholars students and librarians to try to derive some forecasts for future developments and directions in research librarianship The conclusion that forecasts could be made was also based on observation of the myriad of projects and programs initiatives and inventions made possible by the broad and rapid distribution of digital tools and techniques over the World Wide Web What the two presidents observed eighteen months ago was that neither a synthesis nor an overview of digital developments has yet emerged in the fields of higher education and research They found few credible attempts to assess on a national scale what directions might be taken to ensure that librarians and scholars continue to work in the kind of synchrony which had evolved so effectively until the advent of the digital era In November 1997 the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation generously agreed to support a joint ACLSCLIR effort to consider changes in the process of scholarship and instruction that will result from the use of digital technology and to assure that libraries continue to serve the research needs of scholars Presidents Katz and Marcum asked 36 scholars and librarians to convene in five task forces each devoted to one of five types of scholarly resources visual materials manuscript materials audio materials monographs and journals area studies materials Rather than seeking to select truly representative members for each task force the presidents appointed knowledgeable and active practitioners involved in the tumultuous changes wrought in these early years of the digital era and associated with one or more of the five types of scholarly resources being examined The task forces met separately commented via email on matters arising in their meetings and then gathered as a plenary task force for a day in June 1998 to consider threats to and opportunities in amassing providing access to and preserving collections for current and future generations of scholars students and citizens The plenary session was structured as an exchange of views on four strategically interesting topics that had arisen in the preliminary discussions Strategic Issues The four topics for organizing the discussion were the use of finding aids and bibliographical resources the growth and management of collections infrastructure components and copyright and intellectual property issues Discussions in the materials task forces and in the plenary session revealed a fifth issue the need for investment in communication and understanding both within institutions and among institutions throughout the realms of higher education and research Remembering that the members of the task forces ranged in their spheres of influence from the deans provosts and chiefs of major research libraries who are responsible for conducting orchestras of scholarly and support efforts to scholars teachers and subject specialist librarians who are the practitioners of a particular specialty it is perhaps not surprising that views varied dramatically on what was occurring and what should be occurring Ample time had to be invested in each meeting to allow for a full exchange of views even among this carefully selected group of knowledgeable and active practitioners in order to properly address the four main strategic issues Strategic recommendations emerging from the discussions reflected the theme of greater sharing and coordination As the digital era unfolds the lack of a critical mass of shared information may hinder communitywide involvement in philosophical and policy matters of real substance Similarly research and teaching institutions might be well advised to ensure that means are found to create within their communities a broader awareness of advances in core functions made possible by digital techniques so that progress in one discipline might suggest new possibilities for progress in another Another suggestion to individual institutions and to individual scholars within them is to seek a more effective balance in the distribution of resources and responsibilities across the great divide of centralized and decentralized functions Important advances can be made when creative solutions are linked with costeffectiveness Furthermore in the present dynamic environment institutional success may well depend upon skillful balancing of dependability in operational support systems and experimentation to improve performance Cultural Custodianship One theme recurred in all the discussions despite dire predictions of the demise of libraries and of sweeping changes in the roles of librarians the fundamental roles and responsibilities of librarians and libraries in higher education and research remained and would persist Moreover for scholars who are clients of libraries and librarians these roles and responsibilities have been expanded by new communications media and by new techniques based on information technology One task force member identified the fundamental roles and responsibilities of research librarians as selection and acquisition of relevant material provision of intellectual access to such material interpretation of information resources distribution of information resources and preservation of information and of informationbearing artifacts The trend towards collections which resemble one another to the detriment of the amassing of collections of unique material manuscripts archives and rare books was recognized as a threat to the continued success and growth of scholarship and teaching in North America The rapidly escalating cost of purchasing journals in science technology and medicine is driving spending away from investments in collections in the humanities and social sciences in general and away from collections of unique materials in particular A classic response to this problem has been cooperative or collaborative collection development across many research libraries some ongoing and some which have recently been created It was recognized that considerable areas of overlap among holdings are required for library collections to be of service for basic research and basic teaching However there was worry that this overlap was becoming so broad as to threaten the continued health of research programs Regardless of specific concerns it was the shared opinion of all task force members that an effective national discussion leading to agreement on institutional assignments for indepth collection building is needed Furthermore it is expected that a national collaborative collections development program would be cost effective that is it would produce measurable value which is many factors greater than its measurable costs A national discussion on this need would include scholars and other readers and would cover special collections and archives in many different settings including those in the member organizations of the Independent Research Library Association Parenthetically it was noted that cooperation and collaboration within individual institutions was necessary as new programs of teaching and research proliferate Holistic budgeting that includes resources for library collections and services to new programs would help deans and provosts see all the costs and tradeoffs before embarking on initiatives which might otherwise appear to be attractive Holistic or full program budgeting might also help prevent the division of alltoofinite library collection budgets into slices so thin as to be useless Access to Collections The North American system of bibliographic utilities is regarded as a strong base on which to continue to build for even better access This system is based on shared development of and consistent adherence to standards of content and format of bibliographic records and on free access to the vast majority of institutional catalogs and other finding aids The ACLSCLIR task forces agreed it is a priority to develop finding aids for materials in all formats and in all media Renewed diligence is also needed to ensure consistency in the content and format of finding aids even as both the range of media and the volume of data multiply through rapid developments in the Web environment Given the possibility of global access to information about collections about items and about source materials for instruction and study the task force members asserted that there should be new emphasis on and encouragement for the actual use of original materials in the arenas of critical thinkingthe classrooms and seminars the offices and labs of our research communities New targets for further work were identified including national acceptance of a standard for encoded archival description the development of mechanisms for creating and using such descriptions in a networked environment and the development of federated mechanisms to allow discovery and retrieval of such descriptions from the global network Copyright and Intellectual Property Fundamental to the respect of copyrights is knowledge of the rights of creators of content as well as those of readers and users From the ACLSCLIR discussions it was apparent that while many research institutions have duly notified their scholars and students of institutional policies regarding the use of copyrighted material such notification was not sufficient to ensure proper treatment of copyrighted materials More education about the rights and prerogatives of scholars and others who create copyrightable material should be provided perhaps by scholarly societies perhaps by universities and other research institutions Better dissemination of information about the rights of readers under the terms of the copyright law as opposed to the interpretations of the law by various selfinterested parties is also necessary Some task force members argued forcibly that creators of intellectual property might be better off managing their own copyrights rather than ceding them to publishers some of whom have rapidly raised the subscription costs of journals in the sciences technology and medicine It was suggested by a few that faculty sometimes circumvent copyrights and abuse fair use provisions out of pure frustration because of the difficulty of securing reproduction rights The pressure on libraries to find new sources of income creates both a threat and an opportunity The task force members were concerned on the one hand by the threat of narrowing access to content because of annual decreases in purchasing power and slower collections growth and intrigued on the other hand by the possibilities of earning money by selling access to information or selfpublishing of institutionally supported intellectual property Since income can be generated by exploitation of publishable materials owned by research and teaching organizations one solution to the problem of affording continuing collection development might lie in universities exploiting their own material This raises the question of whether readers who otherwise might have had free access would face unfair barriers to access at the very least a public relations campaign to educate readers would be necessary All agreed that sharing experiences in licensing materials and in selfpublishing would be useful It was also recognized that the issues which arise from selling and reselling information are different from those arising from the exploitation by publication of more or less unique materials owned by institutions Components of Infrastructure The discussion revealed important differences in the installed base of technical and support infrastructure among the participants home institutions The question receiving the most emphasis was that of training and support for scholars so that they might more fully exploit the growing capacities of digital systems to present more materials and of digital tools to analyze them more extensively Ironically as rapid advancement occurs in networked information and information technologies distinctions among institutions widen Small colleges and private research libraries adopt new technologies more slowly and their communities tend to lag in their awareness of change in this domain compared to their colleagues at larger universities Because these lags appear to be increasing new mechanisms are required to disseminate successful approaches Some members of the task forces expressed the view that such diversity should be appreciated even as we take steps to ensure broader access to improvements rather than decrying these inevitable dissimilarities Members of the task forces felt that parallel initiatives were necessary one to develop a common infrastructure for easier discovery and retrieval of materials for scholarship and another to define and operate a new system of scholarly communication based on retention of responsibility for scholarly communication by universities and scholarly societies From the distribution of theses and dissertations on the Web to the determination of which digitally born materials need to be preserved and by which methods encompassing all the vast middle ground of publishing reassertion of the role of universities and learned societies as publishers was felt to be a very good thing A thorough takeover of the system of scholarly communication by learned societies and the universities would result in improvements in both its functioning and funding These institutions and societies should embrace the opportunities presented by network technologies Some good partial models of such a new system are already becoming available through publishing projects with university and learned society support There was concern over if not consensus on the need for new investments in digital resources in libraries and in tools to present and manipulate those resources from the workstations of individual scholars and students Attention to both the human and technological components of the scholarly information infrastructure is recommended with special regard to coping with predictable increases in the rate of change and unpredictable changes in the technologies themselves We need to evaluate the ways in which people interact with and learn from technology and to assess learning in which there is a significant component of high technology Summaries of Task Force Meetings Deanna B Marcum President of CLIR opened the five task force discussions and James Morris CLIR vice president led the discussions Each meeting began with a restatement of the rationale for the task forces to ensure that libraries and archives continue to meet the research needs of scholars in the new digital environment CLIR and the ACLS are convening groups of scholars librarians and administrators to discuss how scholarly resources will be used in the future and what impediments may arise to impair their use This report summarizes the groups concerns and makes recommendations about actions to be taken by librarians archivists and others to ensure continued access to research materials in a variety of media for use by teachers students and researchers The process of preparing the report began with summaries of the individual task force discussions which were distributed electronically on a closed listserv Task force members commented on and expanded this draft On June 30 1998 CLIR convened all five groups for the plenary session and this report reflects this gathering as well as the five task force meetings The following informal summaries of the task force meetings give a sense of the range of topics and the disparate views The recurring themes have been extracted and worked into recommendations for further action Area Studies Task Force The role of the area studies task force was to think prospectively about how the nature of research in area studies will change and about how that change will affect what libraries should collect and in what formats The goal is to anticipate the problems that our successors will face and to craft solutions such as efficient and coordinated acquisitions policies Members of the group were invited to ponder whether technology affects their areas of scholarship and if so how If technology allows greater access to scarce resources how do we decide who specifically takes responsibility for the preservation of networked resources And what are the models for governance of those resources Concerns The group first addressed the issue of whether or not the introduction of digital technologies into area studies scholarship had a beneficial or a deleterious effect One strongly held view was that the immediate effects were very damaging since area studies traditionally exists at the margin of resources allocation within libraries Because funds are being invested in digital projectsfew of which involve materials in the vernacular languages of the worldareas studies are being neglected and marginalized One task force member observed that much of the current demand for digital projects is vendordriven not missiondriven and vendors see no profit in the low financial returns associated with area studies A case in point is JSTOR an electronic journal publishing project that was initially funded by The Andrew W Mellon Foundation which does not include areas studies journals due to their low subscription numbers In terms of digital reformatting projects works in nonRoman alphabets have suffered because of the insufficient quality of scanning resolution for these alphabets Furthermore the cascading confusion of standards in the networked environment hard enough to cope with for Englishlanguage sources creates utter chaos in nonRoman alphabet languages In the classroom this marginalization of area studies is compounded by students perception that if a resource does not exist in electronic form it either is not important or does not exist at all Both nonWestern and underdeveloped nations are being dumped or are falling off the table The apparent globalization of the markets does not help with the creation and dissemination of regional resources In fact it actually hurts to the extent that it rewards activities and encourages knowledge creation solely for their commercial value This results in serious gaps in the documentation of local and regional phenomena not to mention alternative or dissident approaches gaps that cannot be filled and will persist as holes in the fabric of recorded information Perspectives that have been created by and that are sympathetic to the expansion of the global economy are already well documented in the Western literature of libraries But where are the voices for example of those opposed to the hydroelectric dams under construction in China There was some disagreement with the original contention that investment in digital projects adversely affects funding for areastudies acquisitions On the one hand a subscription to JSTOR could take 40000 out of the serials budget including that for foreign serials since this cost increase was generally not compensated other subscriptions had to be cut On the other hand members of the task force maintained that digital technology is still a very small proportion of any library budget 3 percent at Berkeley for example Some libraries have seen a reduction in the staff of selectors Others have had the experience of finding useful foreign Internet sites which turn out to be ephemeral and once the site has disappeared there is literally no record of the information that was once available Is anyone archiving these electronic resources The practical issues of coordinating collection development specifically of digital reformatting brought up old frustrations with the cooperative collecting of print materials though the consensus was that the system however ad hoc in its execution nevertheless works rather well Ultimately we shall probably default to letting those libraries with a history of committed collecting continue to do so building strength on strength These same libraries would then also become responsible for preservation and resourcesharing document delivery and interlibrary loan Recommendations A1 Distance learning Several members mentioned areas of success abroad that need further scrutiny to see whether they offer lessons for us Examples worthy of study include the distancelearning models of the UK Australia and New Zealand and the distributed collecting done by the Germans Widening access to area studies experts and resources through distance learning was viewed by some as realistic and salubrious and even as an efficient way to gain new audiences for obscure subjects such as medieval Catalonian literature or the thought of St Augustine Others regarded it as one more threat to the profession because when teachers are considered a resource that can be networked small colleges may believe they have a legitimate excuse to dismiss faculty members and library staff who are already undersupported There was general consensus that while most teachers now had or felt obliged to have Web sites very few of them know how to develop good sites or have the time to maintain and update them A2 Intranet and Internet presence Universities should assist area studies teachers and librarians in developing an Internet presence that is contentdriven and easily kept current Internetbased materials may ease the seemingly intractable problem Western libraries have in acquiring or otherwise gaining access to foreign materials Some members of the task force imagined the possibility of forming partnerships with libraries and archives abroad that would selectively digitize materials and make them available electronically Others cautioned that past experience with analogous microfilming projects had not been uniformly positive The idea of having partner libraries and archives abroad do the selecting and microfilming of materials was well regarded in the abstract but those at the table with experience of foreign cooperative filming programs agreed that a large output of film was not usually the result More often the programs justified the considerable time expense and frustration they incurred because they introduced or built up a basic preservation infrastructure in countries that lacked them The notion of building significant bodies of resources filmed abroad is a chimera Increasing the acquisition of print materials from these nations usually results in a much greater burden on the preservation and collections management staff because the paper is notoriously acidic the bindings weak and the print quality often quite substandard A3 Funding levels Area studies can be reestablished by shoring up a few major programs across the country Private funding for digitization should be sought if this can be done without pandering to commercial interests The discussion of resources inevitably led to speculation about how to find funding at levels appropriate to support area studies staff and collections Money that had flowed into most universities during the Cold War has dried up and welltrained and highly qualified specialists are underemployed or have been forced to leave their fields altogether The trend is not likely to be reversed dramatically but suggestions were made about shoring up area studies in general For example students in certain social science disciplines such as economics should be encouraged to add an area studies focus to their training A4 Faculty involvement ACLS should work with scholarly societies to help members understand the intellectual and fiscal choices that must be made by libraries regarding their collections The discussion of the role that faculty members might play in responding to some of the groups concerns began with a recommendation that they participate in decisions about what to consign to secondary storage It was noted that while many libraries have been successful in getting direction from faculty members about highvolume material decisions about the selection of midlevel and lowerlevel use materials were usually forced back on to the library staff Involving faculty in the weeding processa process absolutely essential to the maintenance of a wellpreserved and easily accessible resource basewas even harder than involving them in selection for offsite storage in the groups experience A5 Resource guide A resource guide to area studies should be mounted on a Web site in order to facilitate resource sharing To guide libraries in their decisions about area studies collections one of the strong institutions in area studies should take responsibility for an online resource guide ACLSCLIR Possible Program Initiatives 1 Given the presence of a global network promote global participation in making scholarly resources available identify and stimulate the growth of programs involving nonNorth American collaboration for the development and distribution of digital information resources 2 Identify the state of network infrastructures in a few key countries including the major industrialized countries and a sampling of developing countries update continuously publish the results of the survey assessment with hyperlinks to appropriate Web pages Audio Materials Task Force The general discussion of the audio materials task force began with comments by the individual task force members about their personal use of audio materials for research and teaching and their administrative responsibilities for audio collections The Underuse of Audio Materials The consensus of the task force was that the store of audio materials available in repositories around the country is at once indescribably rich and for various reasons underutilized by both scholars and the general public The discussants made a distinction between scholars and users based largely on the complexity of the tools which scholars require to do their work The materials are underutilized at least in part because the bibliographic resources are woefully deficient and therefore it is not widely known that these materials exist Before scholars can mine the riches they must have at least a rudimentary awareness of what is there to be explored How do you build a critical mass of audio materials and make them available to scholars The use itself will stimulate evaluation and promote still greater use The task force agreed on the fundamental need for bibliographic control of these materials and for cataloging at levels of completeness to be determined to let people know what is available and to begin to provide subject access to collections They stressed the importance of finding aids even from amateur sources and the need for new sets of tools in the digital environment to manipulate audio filesfor example to integrate sound with images of a musical score and liner notes and to transmit the composite across a campus for instructional purposes They also agreed on the need to train scholars to use audio documentary sources and said that older scholars in particular are unaware of what the new digital environment can offer for their research Some members of the audio materials task force cautioned that for certain kinds of research the digital surrogate will not be adequate In speculating about whether technology might ever provide an adequate substitute for the artifactby allowing topographical reading of a record for example using digital images of the recordthey asked whether the market for such specialized kinds of technology would ever be large enough to warrant their development and subsequent support The cost factors were acknowledged to be inescapable and sobering One member observed that the nature of the technological mechanisms needed to search across remote repositories makes the cost of providing access extraordinary It was suggested that perhaps just a few institutions should take responsibility for keeping audio materials and for making them accessible indeed the economics of access may so require But some members of the task force maintained that there is also value in a more scattered distribution of the materials Copyright The fundamental issue of what constitutes a text in the digital environment has yet to be resolved even as digital libraries complicate the problem by making possible the creation of new documents from existing documents How then does the reach of copyright extend to the creation use reuse and distribution of these compound documents One member of the task force remarked that the process of rights management has at least four aspects control of access use or nonuse of encryption authentication and a secure method of payment when required The panel agreed that the copyright issues are thorny and troubling but they avoided discussing specific practices or answering the hard questionsfor example what changes to copyright law are required for scholars to have access to audio materials over library networks or what would the widespread introduction of licensing arrangements including blanket licenses mean for the use of audio materials Some task force members thought it would be instructive for some institutions to tackle the copyright issues by seizing the initiative on access and prompting legal rulings One participant reported that copyrighted materials are distributed electronically without permission at his university but only for instructional purposes within the bounds of the campus The legality of this semiprudent procedure has not been tested Recommendations B1 Finding aids B1 a The task force was in general agreement on the fundamental need for bibliographic control of audio collections and for finding aidsof whatever degree of completenessto acquaint scholars and the larger public with the existence of these materials and to promote their use The principal problem with spokenword materials is the cost of proper cataloging with tapes there is no getting around the need to listen in real time to know precisely what is there Given the great volume of materials to be processed the costs of cataloging and the surely limited amounts of money to get it done what if any degree of compromise about the completeness of records is possible in structuring databases and finding commonalities Library catalogers are traditionally disposed to prefer completeness but is there not real benefit in the provision of at least some information as compared to no information about audio materials The question of course is how much information is needed for scholars to know whether they will find the materials useful B1 b The task force endorsed the notion of compiling inventories of audio materials which would provide something between a full catalog record and a mere list Once the inventories have been created it will be easier to decide what may warrant full cataloging While some task force members urged scholars to set priorities for cataloging audio materials librarians cautioned that such directives may be unreliable Todays scholarly interests may not be viewed so favorably in the future The responsibility they thought would fall to curators B1 c Information technologies should be used 1 to help create the finding aids perhaps by imposing standards on existing data to bring them up to code and build a thesaurus or by entering data into an existing thesaurus and 2 to disseminate the bibliographic information B2 Costs The group agreed that a framework for coordinating the digitizing effort and serving as the underpinning for cooperative activity is essential They further agreed that the database is the essential component of a frameworkand in the encouraging words of one participant We already have it One member of the panel made the following critically important observation We are moving from toy digital libraries to the next stage of digital libraries when they will grow substantially and we shall do something very wasteful if we all digitize the same things Within a widely recognized framework new models of consortial sharing may evolve and the inadequate delivery mechanisms that have been the undoing of resourcesharing efforts in the past may be rendered efficientand therefore acceptablein the digital environment Because the financial costs are so high institutions will also need to reallocate resources in order to create large virtual collections and not just of audio materials and make them accessible ACLSCLIR Possible Program Initiatives 1 Survey the state of availability of audio materials for scholarship and teaching on the network 2 Survey the state of information technology available to principal audio archives including state and federal collections 3 Promote participation of audio industry for 1 and 2 above by communicating to the industry the importance of noncommercial uses of audio material on the network to the intellectual community Manuscript Materials Task Force The purposes of the manuscript materials task force are to learn more about what scholars and teachers who rely on manuscript materials will need from libraries and archives in the future and to help librarians and archivists address those needs now in order to ensure future access to manuscript resources These issues are made more pressing by the everincreasing volume of information being generated and disseminated electronically The ACLSCLIR interest in the longterm accessibility of digital records was illustrated through discussion of the film which the two organizations recently produced on the problem of preservation in the digital environment Into the Future and through a brief recapitulation of some of the problems that the proliferation of information in digital form creates Manuscript Formats The types of manuscript materials that have proven the most useful for researchers over time are diaries correspondence and other selfreflective genres as well as draft versions of creative works account books and business records The future of some of these genres is unpredictable however The frequency of written correspondence has dropped off dramatically with the spread of telephony the automobile and mass transportation Is written correspondence being succeeded by email which appears to be replacing a significant share of some types of telephone exchanges and which unlike telephone calls can indeed leave a record of the content of the communication If so do we need to make a concerted effort to preserve email communications or should we rely on the correspondents to do so as we have in the past with paper records The preferred format for use of manuscript materials is in theory the original of course but reformatted papers and printed editions are not only quite acceptable but at times preferred for ease of use The group acknowledged that microfilming is an indispensable method for preserving fragile materials despite the distinct limitations of microforms in access and the librarians and archivists present expressed a general concern that there will simply never be enough resources to preserve as much material as we would like Digitally converted items may be much easier to use but largescale projects for the digital conversion of original manuscripts do not appear to be the silver bullet for resolving either preservation or access issues because of the high price and the unproven utility of such programs Examples of the policy and procedural questions of creating archives of email and other digital communications are the controversy between the American Historical Association and the National Archives and Records Administration and John Carlins September 1998 statement We All Stand to Gain If NARA Gets Budget Breakthrough The first may be found on the Web site of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibilities httpwwwcpsrorgcpsrfoiaPROFSCASE and the second on the Web site of George Mason University httpchnmgmueduahaperspadvancedtaffunctiondetailampLayout1uid132924 Access to Manuscript Materials The most significant impediment to greater access to manuscript materials is the lack of adequate finding aids in easily located sites The highest priority therefore is to continue to create machinereadable records of manuscript holdings and make those records easily accessible on the Web or on a bibliographical utility Other less remediable and perhaps intractable impediments include the vexed and vexing issue of copyright particularly in such collections as personal correspondence which may contain received mail from a variety of third parties all of whom hold the rights to their own letters and the ongoing efforts of heirs to control the fate of an individuals papers or to try to protect the reputation of the creator by censoring the record Repositories are seldom able to loosen any of the restrictions imposed on use by donors and their heirs Other problems may vanish over time such as the hoarding of access to collections for which institutions may have paid a great deal of money and that they are therefore reluctant to share through reformatting This reluctance may be quite misguided if it is based on the view that the artifactual that is market value of the collection should take precedence over its research value Only time and change in the leadership of institutions can overcome such reluctance Building Future Collections One member of the task force noted that a distinct disadvantage of having his staff concentrate so much on making collections accessibleby creating finding aids encoding documents to make them Webaccessible and other such activitiesis that the specialists have less and less time to devote to collection development a critical and quite timeconsuming activity Others added comments about the types of documents that will be collected in the future and how difficult it will be to ensure preservation of say ephemera or email The upshot was an admission that just as they have done in the past libraries and archives in the future will have to rely on amateur collectorssuch as those who scooped up all the ephemera created during the peace movement of the 1960s a collection now housed at UCLA In greater peril perhaps are government records that are being created electronically but are not being preserved systematically nor made accessible Several court cases brought against the National Archives have highlighted both how widespread electronic records are in government and how unprepared we are to save them It is estimated for example that by the year 2000 75 percent of all federal government transactions will be conducted electronically Yet only in the past few months has the National Archives established a working group to deal with retention policies for such records The group touched only briefly on the future of paper records as distinct from records generated electronically without traditional drafts and on the proliferation of information recorded on video and audio formats They felt that a discussion of such matters would be productive only in conjunction with the other task forces Manuscripts on Campuses Several members spoke of past and present efforts at their institutions to involve faculty members and students in the active use of primary source documentation The relatively new emphasis at research universities on undergraduate education was seen as hurting the research endeavor including its resource base One way to respond to the shift is to work closely with faculty members in helping them to integrate the use of manuscripts into the undergraduate curriculum something that students seem universally to enjoy On the other hand the requirement of some universities that every course have its own home page may further jeopardize the role of primary source research in the teaching agenda So too may a mandated survey approach to curriculum development when it leads to a superficial sweep over vast amounts of information without allowing a few wellchosen stops from which to bore deeply into an event through the close reading of primary documentation Preservation and Archiving Issues It was agreed that such notions as archiving the Web may not be meaningful for future researchers In one persons words there is simply too much information Who will decide what is significant and should be preserved Would it be useful to develop collection development guidelines for unpublished materials that would be analogous to those the Research Libraries Group RLG promulgated for published resources in its Conspectus A high degree of confidence was expressed in the ability of collectors and researchers to sort out what is worth saving by exercising judgment about what they deem to be of longterm interest Most of the information that a culture creates is of limited utility and dies a natural death and this natural process of attrition will continue Recommendations C1 Finding aids Focus on the creation of finding aids and making them Webaccessible A researcher should be able with a single search to find all the recorded instances of the manuscript materials on his or her chosen topic C2 Projectbyproject justification Do not invest too heavily in wholesale digital conversion of manuscript materials Each project should be well defined in purpose adhere to the highest scholarly standards and shun the opportunistic or fashionable C2 Public records Pay more attention to the appropriate retention of public electronic records than of private ones We can reasonably expect private records to be kept in one form or another by interested parties Retaining public records however poses a much greater problem and has implications that go beyond future scholarship ACLSCLIR Possible Program Initiatives Publish widely the Encoded Archival Description EAD projects that are underway in libraries and archives and attempt to identify projects proposed for conversion of finding aids to EAD Continue the investigation of acceptable techniques for digital preservation publish ever more widely the ongoing saga of this investigation in the journals of each and every constituent member of ACLS and its sister organizations Monographs and Journals Task Force The purpose of the monographs and journals task force is to learn more about what scholars and students who use books and journals need and expect from libraries and to help librarians think about their future role in ensuring access to such resources Future problems and opportunities should be viewed in light of the changing nature of information technology The Changing Nature of Publishing In the fields of science technology and medicine STM journals represent the frontier and are used much more than monographs which tend to review the current state of the field Just the opposite is true in the humanities Moreover journal publishing in the social sciences and humanities can take years while in general STM journals race new work into print Academic institutions are both producers and consumers of scholarly publishing Faculty members and students produce work which is reviewed and if accepted edited by academic peers often for a commercial publisher Libraries must then buy back the published work at escalating prices The problem is especially serious with scientific journals which are the most expensive Social science and humanities journals tend to be less expensive Commercial publishers have aggressively expanded the publication of journals over the past several years For example the American Physical Society publishes 90000 pages per year in a variety of journals when once it published only 800010000 pages annually So commercial publishers have both created more products and also raised their prices to maximize income The task force called attention to an issue that has arisen from the online availability of journals namely the instability of the information foundation Because subscribers license online resources and do not own them users have no recourse when the ownerpublisher takes those resources offline They are gone Commercial interests rather than scholarly or academic ones often drive these decisions Electronic publication of some articles is more powerful than print publication for example when threedimensional illustrations must be used or in cases when the user wants to see variants on text such as in translated and annotated materials However there are problems in evaluating electronic publications Print journals have a limited number of pages so editors have to be selective about what to include Ejournals are not so physically limited and they tend to be more inclusive Also there is a hierarchy in print journals in any discipline certain journals are considered better and more selective Without even reading an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine for example a researcher knows that it is likely to be of high quality The value added by editors and peer reviewers and the established reputations of certain journals go a long way in helping researchers know what should receive their attention first No such similar mechanisms now exist in electronic publishing Preservation and Access The electronic storage of journals brings benefits for both preservation and access JSTOR centralizes storage of journals and sees to their preservation through digital migration relieving libraries of this burden This works especially well with journals where frequently the artifact is less important than the content There is a paradox in preservation with print resources the less they are used the better they can be preserved With digital information the opposite is true Continued use demand ensures that the information will be migrated as often as necessary to remain usable in electronic form Preservation of esoteric pieces is most often at risk because lowuse materials are often neglected In seeking to build our knowledge base we may be taking a step back from preserving lessused materials that nonetheless have high value to researchers now and later Better and more complete catalogs of available works would help librarians make decisions about what to preserve In the nineteenth century different fields organized different bibliographic activities so that local items could be contributed It would be a good idea to bring critical thinkers from international groups together to look at knowledge bases and develop a plan for their mapping Some scholars have experienced inconvenience in using older materials relegated to remote storage even worse some original materials have been destroyed after being put on microfiche Microfiche and other microforms are described by some as hard to use because the microform readers are often out of commission the indices are difficult to access and the endnotes inconvenient to read in conjunction with the text they gloss Librarians and other responsible parties were urged to think more about preserving old monographs even if this comes at the expense of a few journal subscriptions The question was raised whether universities are moving away from reformatting to microforms for preservation or content There is less money for reformatting for example one major library now gets half of what it used to receive for preservation Library reformatting programs have focused on Americana in response to the priorities of the National Endowment for the Humanities NEH but libraries have rich collections of materials from many other national regional and ethnic sources that are valuable and merit conservation Expanding reformatting efforts for material outside of the NEH priorities would be expensive and such projects could take many decades Most preservation work is done with grant money and preservation funds from outside agencies are earmarked Internal funds can be allocated to preservation purposes but in general internal funds have not been reallocated to extend preservation work beyond that made possible by grant money Selection Issues Many publishers of Internet editions of scholarly journals insist upon purchases of an entire suite of titles rather than allowing librarians to select and pay for individual titles Publishers engaging in this kind of marketing seek to maintain their cash flow from subscribing institutions In response libraries are joining together to buy suites of online publications rather than buying only what they need as individual libraries Librarians accepting such arrangements justify their choice by pointing to the greater local availability of an expanded number of titles However site licenses such as these tend both to increase the provision of littleused information and to continue the established profitability of certain publishers both undesirable consequences albeit unintended Before World War II scholars played a large role in selection and collection building Their knowledge of the materials helped librarians build solid collections with the least overlap among research collections Today conditions are very different and nonspecialist librarians often do not have the information on which to base judgments about buying highly specialized materials Small universities and colleges benefit from groups of local scholarly advisors who guide them in purchasing materials to support their disciplines Selecting material for offsite storage is a difficult task for librarians Stacks are full and there are few major library building projects Librarians have little choice but to relegate the lessused materials to less expensive offsite storage The faculty who do use these materials feel disadvantaged because they must wait while materials are retrieved The demise of the card catalog and the unfortunate reality of offsite storage have also removed the opportunity to peruse titles in the same or neighboring cataloging categories on the shelves It was noted that work has been done to develop a catalog that would allow you to view a shelf on the computer terminal to permit browsing by classification Visions for the Future of Technology and Scholarship Are the technological alternatives to old systems adequate for scholars purposes today Many visioning sessions held on campuses today seem unable to provide a sense of the functions technology will provide for libraries and archives in 10 to 15 years There is a feeling that we are moving along in a haphazard way there is as yet no strategy that says to make the information environment work for us we need certain specified technological devices and capacities Some libraries are interested in the development of a vision and many librarians do have a vision of a system and how components will interrelate in the short term they could benefit from working with visionaries in the computer industry A number of development projects are in fact underway in the industry some even with library partners but they seem uncoordinated Members of the task force believe that there may be a disconnect between the vision that librarians have of their audience and the readers own desires In the minds of many readers today the Web seems to define real knowledge The task force was also concerned about the potential neglect of the documentary base for the history of disciplines Disciplinary histories have fallen out of fashion and many scholars are no longer interested in the history of their own fields But unless the electronic record is kept future scholars will no longer have the choice to return to this history For instance the history of science and technology has not been well studied in recent years and the documentary base remains largely intact however without renewed interest it could fail to be maintained Library staff have the advantage now of using the Internet to make experts more available The task members discussed the practical aspects of putting scholarly materials on the Web Currency of information presented is crucial if the author does not make revisions it is possible for readers to amend the work themselves by adding annotations Thus the Web allows a live interactive publication It is also possible for scholars to present their own work directly on the Web When librarians select material to be digitized and place it on the Web they add the function of Internet publishing to their many other roles The Future of the Monograph Monographs are still a good way to communicate libraries will continue to buy them as long as they are published Some task force members wondered whether university presses have moved away from monographs because they are finding it increasingly difficult to sell books Libraries may be the last market for highly specialized monographs Ondemand printing of monographs may become increasingly important in the next few years as demonstrated by the Columbia University pilot project that has mounted monographs online Many task force members regret the decline in the publication of the monographic series but recognize that the current economies of monographic publishing are discouraging Recommendations D1 Improve access Give more attention to improving accessibility of materials that have been put in storage or copied to microformats The construction of a virtual library shelf would be helpful D2 Information costs We need to know more about the real costs of information Technology is turning the library into a new type of scholarly resource Yet provosts have no idea how much is being spent on library and information resources since most of the budget for these resources is scattered under different budget categories such as communications functions computers and networks and storage D3 Booklike qualities The book is still the best technology for many researchers The qualities that make it so useful such as page turning and indexes can be better incorporated into advances in information technology D4 Access vs acquisition In budgeting do not think only about acquiring new materials Consider also what can be done to make better use of what is already available as through electronic resources that make print resources more available such as indexes D5 Cost sharing Find new and efficient ways to share costs among libraries ACLSCLIR Possible Program Initiatives 1 The plight of notforprofit scholarly publishing needs to be more widely known and understood Forprofit scientific publishers have so increased prices that the cost of subscriptions has come to take up a disproportionate share of library budgets and humanitiesbased monographs have become more and more underrepresented ACLS and CLIR should monitor the evolution of scholarly communications practices and regularly distribute information about the implications to the higher education community 2 ACLSCLIR might commission a study of the prospects for truly innovative research using digital information resources CLIR and ACLS should follow these developments closely and provide followon investigation analysis and publication of relevant Web sites More convenient tools for discovery retrieval manipulation and analysis are needed for the publishing genres of monographs journals and of related materials such as social scientific data sets and collections of digital source materials in all disciplines Word searching and counting and analysis tools are common but some linguists are involved in more daring and extensive research involving meaning investigation of generative techniques and wordterm association tools which could be suitable for wider application Visual Materials Task Force The purpose of the visual materials task force is to learn more about what scholars and students who use visual resources need and expect from libraries archives or museums and to help librarians archivists and curators think about their future role in ensuring access to such resources Most of the discussion focused on the digitization of visual materials and the creation of new digital images born digital In the first case there was concern about whether the culture is learning to be satisfied with surrogates in the second case the problem is storage and preservation Use of Surrogates versus Originals The task force members reflected on their experiences with digital images One member observed that high school and university students today are using electronic resources almost exclusively If a publication is not on the Web for these students it does not exist Whereas a previous generation of students did research in the library using print materials students today rarely use print resources even as a supplement This change in practice has severely limited the body of information resources that students consult for research Another member pointed out that the opposite is still true at art museums Although digital images have greatly improved access to art art historians are hooked on the original The wide availability of digital surrogates has not decreased interest in viewing the original in fact the availability of digital surrogates can stimulate demand for hard copy as occurred when Oxford University Press mounted a series of publications online in full text Oxford took the unusual step of making the full text available online because they considered the publications to be of marginal general interest and unlikely to generate revenue even in hard copy But as a result of this online exposure hardcopy sales of these publications surpassed their most optimistic expectations An interesting parallel can be noted with the publication of color plates after World War II which coincided with more public visits to museums On the other hand surveys conducted by the College Art Association found that art faculty want access to art images even if they are at low resolution or of poor quality In some ways the image can be considered a surrogate for a bibliographic record Even if it is poor it is an access point a superficial level of information that the Web is useful for delivering Factors Influencing Availability of Digital Visual Material The future use of electronicbased visual materials is highly specific to each field of study However several factors are likely to influence the creation and availability of digital images 1 Value added First in any field one must ask what value is gained from using digital images One must look at what the medium does best what can be done in digital format that cannot be done in other formats and how effective is the medium in distributing particular types of information The answers vary among disciplines but there are many good examples In medicine the use of animated anatomical drawings is a powerful teaching tool In the humanities the project to digitize and share images of papyrus holdings from around the world is bringing these fragile pieces together virtually and enabling researchers to exchange digital annotations 2 Costeffectiveness Increasingly decisions about whether to keep and where to store paperbased holdings are based on the frequency of their use The same is true of decisions about whether to acquire or create and maintain digital information Many materials of high scholarly value are rarely used Thus it is likely that a large body of important but lowuse research material will not become available electronically On the other hand it is usually costeffective to maintain electronic versions of highuse journals or required course materials 3 Stability of medium Digital archives should ascertain what is original and what is a copy There must be standards for archival storage and it will be necessary to document the history of the migration of content 4 Ownership and use rights Museums increasingly are unwilling to make their images available online out of concern for how they will be used or fear of losing money Museums are debating ways to address this should they mount lowresolution images Include watermarks Publishers are often reluctant to grant permission to mount something on the Web This motivates permissionseekers to think of ways to present their request to the rights holders so that they will be more likely to allow use It was felt that publishers fears about electronic distribution have affected the notion of fair use For years librarians have been able to allow photocopying for fair use research purposes However copyright has become far more restrictive with digital information and fair use may not exist on the Web in the future The Role of the Librarian in the Electronic Age What are the roles of librarians when so many others are now involved in the creation packaging and delivery of information and when information can so easily be retrieved at home Librarians are the only professionals who are trained to organize knowledge create organizational systems and understand standards Computer programmers bring order out of chaos only as far as this can be done electronically A librarian takes that electronic material and integrates it into the collection linking print and electronic resources How can we reach the same level of confidence and organization when using digital resources as when using physical resources For example the availability and provision of digital information raises questions of how to ensure authenticity Also how should a librarian select for preservation Librarians have played a major role in building the great research collections Currently there is no one who does thisor could do thisin cyberspace The traditional library model in which people who knew books gave careful thought to creating collections that would best serve researchers stands in sharp contrast to the free market of ideas represented by the Web today In fifty years if we look back on the great research collections that have been built over time will the 1990s mark a change in their character Will funds spent on improving access to information by digital means be taken away from acquisition and preservation of paperbased materials To the extent that some research that includes visuals maps or charts is available only on the Web as is increasingly the case with scientific disciplines how will librarians know what to select There may be more than one version of the material and the open structure of the Web means that much of the material available there has not been peer reviewed As for the role of the librarian in digital collection development the most important thing is to understand the institutions objectives why does it want to create a digital resource base Often the goal is to raise visibility How do these goals and objectives compare with the need to add new materials to the collection Librarians must talk with faculty and find out what is happening at the departmental level At Harvard for example it is the faculty who select materials to be digitized for curricular purposes Librarians can help develop digital collections by ensuring that frequently used items are pointed to and referenced It is also important to think about all the possible audiences for digitized images and other items so that they are presented and indexed in a way that is most useful for a broad audience and that relates to the problems to be solved More information is needed about what materials students use The Andrew Mellon Foundation has sponsored a project to learn how students and faculty use museums for research MITs Media Lab was cited as an example of a digital resource for problembased learning Librarians will increasingly need to understand electronic publishing and intellectual property laws and regulations This is especially important to those who develop exhibitions for the Web Librarians can also benefit from a discussion of how to handle subversive or controversial material Examples include the display of recipes for explosives in exhibitions and of images which some might consider offensive Concern over controversial materials is especially an issue for visual resources curators Finding Aids for Image Collections Some task force members felt that creating access to existing digital images through finding aids is the most important thing that can be done Participants agreed that indexing of image collections is the key problem to making digital information usable A key issue is the training and redeployment of staff into Web specialist positions focused upon cataloging and indexing collections While some institutions are cataloging collections of images not many are indexing individual images As a consequence metadata on image collections may become increasingly available while access to individual images remains limited Standardized cataloging systems for museum use have not evolved as they have for libraries Librarians claim to know how museums ought to be cataloging their holdings and are agitating to unify the recording of visual holdings in a way that would fit into existing bibliographic formats However most library catalogers are trained to catalog books and journals Very few are trained as both curators and bibliographers who can deal with special materials Search mechanisms for retrieving individual images in collections would allow queries by subject image or time of origin It was acknowledged however that scholars are not driving the creation of such image retrieval systems Photo stock houses and other image providers are trying to find ways to search images and the military has also done research in this area The need for finding aids becomes more acute when the collection is open to large numbers of users on the Web as in the case of the Library of Congress LC LC has mounted many images on the Web as part of its digital library and has thus made them widely accessible In many other cases when an institution digitizes its special collections the images are usually not open to users outside the institution Harvards poster collection for example is now being scanned but will not be put on the Web It is hoped a system could be developed to allow virtual browsing of books or images that would be cataloged or housed in proximity to each other as they are in libraries It would be very useful to develop a way of looking at sets of objects onscreen even though the actual item may be stored offsite At the very least one should be able to bring up the title pages contents and a list of illustrations at the terminal Harvard is developing a system that will allow a reader to peruse the stacks on the monitor in this way Archiving of Electronicbased Materials Preserving Webbased information presents a serious challenge Librarians do not download materials from the Web to save them Because the Web is so vast and constantly changing it is impossible for librarians to select and capture the best information in hard copy Rather they create links to good sites and monitor them to ensure the quality is maintained At present there are no electronic archival systems for the Web although there are efforts to create them Maintaining digital information over time has involved the need to migrate it so that it is converted into new formats to keep it usable as new technological platforms emerge In the medical schools one participant reported migration of information for curricular use has not been a problem As long as information is constantly used it will survive digitally However there was concern that without formal systems for archiving a larger body of digital information may perish through benign neglect Storage is also a problem Many museums with vast collections have not found a system for the storage of the vast collections of information available on the Web assuming that such a system could be constructed it is doubtful that any institution could afford it Even though the costs of digital memory have gone down dramatically as the capacity of storage media have increased the true costs include the capture which costs between 4 and 8 per image and the cataloging of digital images Film and Video Two characteristics of still images also apply to film and video images it is often difficult to discern whether the copy one is perusing is an original or an authorized or unauthorized copy and it is often difficult to know under what circumstances the copy was made and thus what rights need to be considered in instructional or research use In the future would film and video images be used increasingly as a primary source for research The consensus was that while films are used heavily for instruction there is no indication that they are being consulted as primary sources except perhaps for ethnographic work There is less of a historical imperative to keep film in its original form because surrogate forms will capture most of the important aspects However film historians insist upon viewing film rather than video copies although most repositories of current films acquire them as video versions Recommendations E1 Improve access Many of the visual resources housed in libraries and archives have not been indexed or cataloged Until bibliographic access is provided these materials cannot be fully exploited by scholars E2 Longterm preservation As more visual resources are digitized and made available on the Web ways must be found to ensure preservation of the digital files just as the originals need to be preserved for as long as possible E3 Integration In the future visual resources will grow in importance as primary source materials Librarians must find ways to integrate these visual resources into the mainstream functions of the research library ACLSCLIR Possible Program Initiatives ACLS and CLIR should convene museum and library curators to discuss the most productive way to provide digital surrogates of visual resources on the Web taking into consideration issues of authenticity intellectual property rights and costs Summary of Plenary Meeting of Task Forces June 30 1998 On June 30 1998 the days discussion was organized around four principal topics on which the participants had been asked to reflect in advance finding aids collections management infrastructure components and copyright The principal actions recommended during the consideration of each topic are summarized here including indications as to which recommendations were assigned the highest priority Finding Aids and Bibliographical Resources There was general agreement that the highest priority should be given to developing finding aids for materials in all formats and to setting appropriate and accepted standards for the finding aids The lack of consistency in the data and metadata used to find materials is a real problem There were divergent views over whether energy and funding should be directed toward the retrospective conversion to electronic form of existing finding aids or toward the creation of new finding aids for unprocessed collections The problem with unprocessed and undescribed collections is indeed great but CLIR and ACLS are not in a position to have a direct role in solving it Instead these organizations should find ways 1 to promote the importance for research of artifacts in all formats and 2 to encourage faculty members to build courses and seminars around original materials and collections that need description Together faculty members and students would begin to describe materials for which there are as yet no finding aids The notion that scholars will not use materials or documents if they cannot be found on the Web was introduced questioned and largely dismissed Serious scholars will always leave their chairs to find the materials they need Students however may not be disposed to look beyond what appears to them on a screen Other actions which the task forces recommended for CLIR or other agents to undertake are to advocate the national acceptance of EAD for marking up finding aids develop software that would make it easier to create EAD documents promote a complete national and ideally international inventory of finding aids and advocate the development of federated mechanisms to find the finding aids which would encompass the international dimension of searching and navigating Collections Management There should be a national discussion about the custody of culture the development of collections and the formulation of policies that assign responsibility for both unique resources and common resources Escalating costs and shrinking financial resources are causing collections to become more alike as libraries seek to satisfy the demands of the many rather than promote and preserve the special collections they may house which are less known and less used If libraries deaccession their infrequently used materials we run the risk of not being certain there is at least one copy of a particular item or title remaining in the US How do we make sure that the unique copy does not disappear How do we develop a framework for debating the need to develop distinctive collections against the current trend of homogenized collections that merely mirror one another We must confront the escalating cost of journals in the sciences medicine and technology which has taken money away from collection development in the humanities and social sciences and reduced the funds available for buying materials from abroad Yet again and even more forcefully than in the past we must encourage cooperation among libraries What can be learned from cooperative models that have worked in the past such as the Farmington Plan Cooperation will be essential as university libraries are forced to make tough decisions about what they must cut and where they should focus their collection development efforts They should make their decisions only after good and timely communication with faculty members Indeed there is a need for new structures to bring together scholars librarians and technical experts to ensure that scholars share the burden of selection in managing collection development at institutions For example faculty members and librarians should work together when new curricula are introduced at institutions This needs to be done institution by institution but CLIR should have a role in promoting the idea and in organizing certain model and demonstration events Librarians need to inform faculty members in detail about the constraints under which libraries are working and engage them in the process of making decisions about collection development Faculty members at institutions with small academic libraries who find the materials they need on the Web or in large research libraries may be ignoring their local libraries and their indifference may be yet another factor contributing to the disconnection that is perceived to exist between faculty members and librarians We should not forget under the enchantment of technological advances that a splendid cataloging system is already in place The technology has replaced neither reference libraries nor reference librarians and browsing the shelves is still an important research technique We must make good use of organizations such as the Center for Research Libraries and the Research Libraries Group that have been created to extend collections and reduce costs We must explore how libraries can connect with cottageindustry archiving models to fulfill their archiving obligation Infrastructure Components There is a need for structured RampD investment by universities in electronic resources and in the effective presentation and manipulation of information on the computer screen But where can RampD money be found within the academic community to experiment with components of the electronic environment and to describe models for incorporating digital information into the information infrastructure of campuses Online library catalogs have been incorporated into campus networks but digital library projects have not We must develop an infrastructure that makes it easy for scholars and students to find materials CLIR could encourage the exploration of ways for universities to license or otherwise acquire and distribute electronic resources We must help scholars to become comfortable with the technology and to understand its capacities and its limitations We must pay particular attention to how people interact with and learn from the technology because better understanding in this area will help us to develop better access strategies and perhaps build an electronic resource for information about instructional technology And as we decide how the human and technological components of the scholarly information infrastructure will fit together we must be certain that we are providing for them over the long term We should begin to define an ideal new system of scholarly communication and take steps to encourage its widespread acceptance Such steps might include urging universities to take dissertations in electronic form and encouraging learned societies to give prizes for articles that exist only in an electronic format We should embrace the opportunity the technology offers to develop new structures for the creation and dissemination of knowledge and take back from the commercial sector some of the important functions of publication The goal should be to devise mechanisms that allow highimpact lowcost publications We must create a mechanism through which learned societies can engage in discussion of the preservation issues surrounding digitization and begin to participate in the process of choosing resources to be digitized Unlike decisions with respect to print materials decisions about the preservation of digital materials must be taken at the time the materials are created Scholarly societies must be made to understand the importance of their contributing to these decisions We must convene funders to explain to them the importance of issues affecting processes of scholarly communication Copyright of Intellectual Property There should be an honest and full discussion of copyright and intellectual property issues with faculty members who inadvertently and otherwise do not always respect copyright restrictions The issues are complicated in part because faculty members are both rights holders and users Time costs and the frustrations involved in securing rights are the common factors that contribute to faculty members circumvention of copyright There are differences in copyright issues for general collections and those for special and museum collections The educational effort about copyright might begin with professional societies Faculty members should be informed about ways to better manage the intellectual property they create and publishers who are parasitic on the academic community in their exploitation of this intellectual property should be identified and criticized openly There should be a resource for libraries and other academic organizations to consult when they work with commercial ventures so that they can learn from the experience of others for example regarding the licensing of their primary materials to the commercial sector What have contracts included in the past Are there common models Because digitizing is expensive libraries may well contemplate recouping some of the costs of having digitized materials to which they hold copyright The idea of charging for the information they provide is in conflict with the libraries traditional sense of themselves as sources of free access to information But charges may be inevitable How much can libraries charge without being perceived as unfair And how can users be educated to the necessity of the charges Recommendations F1 Finding aids F1 a Advocate acceptance of the EAD standard for form

ltbrgt Presidentltbrgt ACLSlttdgt lttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt APPENDIX B Task Force Recommendations Area Studies A1 Distance learning Several members mentioned areas of success abroad that need further scrutiny to see whether they offer lessons for us Examples worthy of study include the distancelearning models of the UK Australia and New Zealand and the distributed collecting done by the Germans Widening access to area studies experts and resources through distance learning was viewed by some as realistic and salubrious and even as an efficient way to gain new audiences for obscure subjects such as medieval Catalonian literature or the thought of St Augustine Others regarded it as one more threat to the profession because when teachers are considered a resource that can be networked small colleges may believe they have a legitimate excuse to dismiss faculty members and library staff who are already undersupported There was general consensus that while most teachers now had or felt obliged to have Web sites very few of them know how to develop good sites or have the time to maintain and update them A2 Intranet and Internet presence Universities should assist area studies teachers and librarians in developing an Internet presence that is contentdriven and easily kept current Internetbased materials may ease the seemingly intractable problem Western libraries have in acquiring or otherwise gaining access to foreign materials Some members of the task force imagined the possibility of forming partnerships with libraries and archives abroad that would selectively digitize materials and make them available electronically Others cautioned that past experience with analogous microfilming projects had not been uniformly positive The idea of having partner libraries and archives abroad do the selecting and microfilming of materials was well regarded in the abstract but those at the table with experience of foreign cooperative filming programs agreed that a large output of film was not usually the result More often the programs justified the considerable time expense and frustration because they introduced or built up a basic preservation infrastructure in countries that lacked them The notion of building significant bodies of resources filmed abroad is a chimera Increasing the acquisition of print materials from these nations usually results in a much greater burden on the preservation and collections management staff because the paper is notoriously acidic the bindings weak and the print quality often quite substandard A3 Funding levels Area studies can be reestablished by shoring up a few major programs across the country Private funding for digitization should be sought if this can be done without pandering to commercial interests The discussion of resources inevitably led to speculation about how to find funding at levels appropriate to support area studies staff and collections Money that had flowed into most universities during the Cold War has dried up and welltrained and highly qualified specialists are underemployed or have been forced to leave their fields altogether The trend is not likely to be reversed dramatically but suggestions were made about shoring up area studies in general For example students in certain social science disciplines such as economics should be encouraged to add an area studies focus to their training A4 Faculty involvement ACLS should work with scholarly societies to help members understand the intellectual and fiscal choices that must be made by libraries regarding their collections The discussion of the role that faculty members might play in responding to some of the groups concerns began with a recommendation that they participate in decisions about what to consign to secondary storage It was noted that while many libraries have been successful in getting direction from faculty members about highvolume material decisions about the selection of midlevel and lowerlevel use materials were usually forced back on to the library staff Involving faculty in the weeding processa process absolutely essential to the maintenance of a wellpreserved and easily accessible resource basewas even harder than involving them in selection for offsite storage in the groups experience A5 Resource guide A resource guide to area studies should be mounted on a Web site in order to facilitate resource sharing To guide libraries in their decisions about area studies collections one of the strong institutions in area studies should take responsibility for an online resource guide Audio Materials B1 Finding aids B1 a The task force was in general agreement on the fundamental need for bibliographic control of audio collections and for finding aidsof whatever degree of completenessto acquaint scholars and the larger public with the existence of these materials and to promote their use The principal problem with spokenword materials is the cost of proper cataloging with tapes there is no getting around the need to listen in real time to know precisely what is there Given the great volume of material to be processed the costs of cataloging and the surely limited amounts of money to get it done what if any degree of compromise about the completeness of records is possible in structuring databases and finding commonalties Library catalogers are traditionally disposed to prefer completeness but is there not real benefit in the provision of at least some information as compared to no information about audio materials The question of course is how much information is needed for scholars to know whether they will find the materials useful B1 b The task force endorsed the notion of compiling inventories of audio materials which would provide something between a full catalog record and a mere list Once the inventories have been created it will be easier to decide what may warrant full cataloging While some task force members urged scholars to set priorities for cataloging audio materials librarians cautioned that such directives may be unreliable Todays scholarly interests may not be viewed so favorably in the future The responsibility they thought would fall to curators B1 c Information technologies should be used 1 to help create the finding aids perhaps by imposing standards on existing data to bring them up to code and build a thesaurus or by entering data into an existing thesaurus and 2 to disseminate the bibliographic information B2 Costs The group agreed that a framework for coordinating the digitizing effort and serving as the underpinning for cooperative activity is essential They further agreed that the database is the essential component of a frameworkand in the encouraging words of one participant We already have it One member of the panel made the following critically important observation We are moving from toy digital libraries to the next stage of digital libraries when they will grow substantially and we shall do something very wasteful if we all digitize the same things Within a widely recognized framework new models of consortial sharing may evolve and the inadequate delivery mechanisms that have been the undoing of resourcesharing efforts in the past may be rendered efficientand therefore acceptablein the digital environment Because the financial costs are so high institutions will also need to reallocate resources in order to create large virtual collections and not just of audio materials and make them accessible Manuscript Materials C1 Finding aids Focus on the creation of finding aids and making them Webaccessible A researcher should be able with a single search to find all the recorded instances of the manuscript materials on his or her chosen topic C2 Projectbyproject justification Do not invest too heavily in wholesale digital conversion of manuscript materials Each project should be well defined in purpose adhere to the highest scholarly standards and shun the opportunistic of fashionable C3 Public records Pay more attention to the appropriate retention of public electronic records than of private ones We can reasonably expect private records to be kept in one form or another by interested parties Retaining public records however poses a much greater problem and has implications that go beyond future scholarship Monographs and Journals D1 Improve access Give more attention to improving accessibility of materials that have been put in storage or copied to microformats The construction of a virtual library shelf would be helpful D2 Information costs We need to know more about the real costs of information Technology is turning the library into a new type of scholarly resource Yet provosts have no idea how much is being spent on library and information resources since most of the budget for these resources is scattered under different budget categories such as communications functions computers and networks and storage D3 Booklike qualities The book is still the best technology for many researchers The qualities that make it so useful such as page turning and indexes can be better incorporated into advances in information technology D4 Access vs acquisition In budgeting do not think only about acquiring new materials Consider also what can be done to make better use of what is already available as through electronic resources that make print resources more available such as indexes D5 Cost sharing Find new and efficient ways to share costs among libraries Visual Materials E1 Improve access Many of the visual resources housed in libraries and archives have not been indexed or cataloged Until bibliographic access is provided these materials cannot be fully exploited by scholars E2 Longterm preservation As more visual resources are digitized and made available on the Web ways must be found to ensure preservation of the digital files just as the originals need to be preserved for as long as possible E3 Integration In the future visual resources will grow in importance as primary source materials Librarians must find ways to integrate these visual resources into the mainstream

network infrastructures in a few key countries including the major industrialized countries and a sampling of developing countries update continuously publish the results of the survey assessment with hyperlinks to appropriate Web pages Audio Materials 1 Survey the state of availability of audio materials for scholarship and teaching on the network 2 Survey the state of information technology available to principal audio archives including state and federal collections 3 Promote participation of audio industry for 1 and 2 above by communicating to the industry the importance of noncommercial uses of audio material on the network to the intellectual community Manuscript Materials 1 Publish widely the Encoded Archival Description EAD projects that are underway in libraries and archives and attempt to identify projects proposed for conversion of finding aids to EAD 2 Continue the investigation of acceptable techniques for digital preservation publish ever more widely the ongoing saga of this investigation in the journals of each and every constituent member of ACLS and its sister organizations Monographs and Journals 1 The plight of notforprofit scholarly publishing needs to be more widely known and understood Forprofit scientific publishers have so increased prices that the cost of subscriptions has come to take up a disproportionate share of library budgets and humanitiesbased monographs have become more and more underrepresented ACLS and CLIR should monitor the evolution of scholarly communications practices and regularly distribute information about the implications to the higher education community 2 ACLSCLIR might commission a study of the prospects for truly innovative research using digital information resources CLIR and ACLS should follow these developments closely and provide followon investigation analysis and publication of relevant Web sites More convenient tools for discovery retrieval manipulation and analysis are needed for the publishing genres of monographs journals and of related materials such as social scientific data sets and collections of digital source materials in all disciplines Word searching and counting and analysis tools are common but some linguists are involved in more daring and extensive research involving meaning investigation of generative techniques and wordterm association tools which could be suitable for wider application Visual Materials 1 ACLS and CLIR should convene museum and library curators to discuss the most productive way to provide digital surrogates of visual resources on the Web taking into consideration issues of authenticity intellectual property rights and costs APPENDIX D Other ACLSCLIR Projects 1 Survey digitization projects which are bringing retrospective material for humanists and social scientists to the Web update the survey continuously publish the results of the survey with hyperlinks from abstracts to appropriate Web pages 2 Survey research and teaching

libraries Oberlin Group for innovative uses of information technology in presenting metadata and for innovative discovery and retrieval techniques and search engines update the survey continuously publish the results of the survey with hyperlinks from abstracts to appropriate Web pages promote adoption of best practices and tools 4 Commission study on divergence and convergence in library collections perform statistically reliable survey of OCLC and RLG databases to measure replication of titles analyze reports of special collecting in library literature for evidence of change in collecting patterns and rate of accession of special collections promote collecting programs with unique targets 5 Based on projects 1 4 identify redundant and similar efforts publish report on redundancy and promote coordination of unique projects 6 Promote EAD projects particularly those of RLG 7 Continue work with other national organizations on longterm preservation of archival copies of digital information resources commission articles for newspaper publication on archiving the Internet in order to achieve wider recognition of the preservation and archiving issues 8 Promote serious consideration of the eprint archive programs for more fields in STM and for the humanities and social sciences commission a study of the impact of such programs on disciplines 9 Persuade NEH and other funding agencies to continue investing in finding aids and bibliographic projects consider divergence of some of these projects from MARC and even EAD formats and guidelines for the sake of experimenting with intellectual access in new and perhaps more costeffective modes 10 Commission a study on training and support programs targeting faculty and teaching assistants in the use of

archives and libraries around the world have embarked upon projects to digitize portions of their holdings Motivations for this work vary but often the goal is to broaden access facilitate retrieval and reduce handling of the originals With rapidly changing technologies and costs planning for the management of such projects over time becomes difficult As a result much digitizing work today is undertaken in pilot projects that allow institutions to learn by doing and learn from each other The project of the Archivo General de Indias AGI in Seville Spain is an important case study both for its size and for its track record Over the past decade the AGI has digitized more than eleven million pages of documents relating to Spanish history in the New World In addition its system for providing access to the digital documents has been in use for five years The Archives has thus had to deal with the daytoday practical problems of operation and longerterm issues such as obsolescence of hardware software and storage media From the start the AGI was clear about its rationale for digitizing to preserve Its objective was not to create a preservation copy in digital form to replace originals but to offer digital surrogates to reduce the handling of originals Today about onethird of AGIs onsite consultations are done electronically greatly reducing exposure of original documents The report illustrates the range of difficult decisions that managers have faced throughout the project Decisions often had to be made where no precedent existed And as always decisions were bound by time and money forcing choices that were not always optimal but realistic We hope that the experience of the AGI as described in the following report will be a useful case study for planners facing the myriad technical organizational and managerial challenges presented by their own digitizing projects AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author wishes to acknowledge all the people at the Archivo General de Indias who have collaborated in the design development installation and operation of the computerized system The Archivos y Bibliotecas group from Informtica El Corte Ingls gave its close collaboration throughout the project and its advice in preparing the work In the United States several people collaborated in bringing this report to publication Ruth Morales translated the original work from Spanish Dan Hazen and Chris Faulhaber read through the paper and Kathlin Smith edited the English version Hans Rtimann long interested in this project encouraged the writing and publication of this report Introduction Over the past decade the largescale digital reformatting project of the Archivo General de Indias AGI in Seville has received considerable attention for its application of computer technologies to historical archives In 1991 Hans Rtimann and Stuart Lynn prepared a report on the project for the Commission on Preservation and Access The report analyzed advantages and problems and concluded that the AGI project was a useful model for other projects There is much to learn for other applications11 JeanPaul Oddos published a later report on the project in the Bulletin de la Bibliothque de France in 1994 It contains a positive assessment in conclusions entitled Un dmarche exemplaire22 In a UNESCO RAMP report Christopher Kitching commented on the professions interest in the projects outcome Its results will be eagerly awaited by the archival world33 At the official opening of the system presided over by the King and Queen of Spain Charles Kesckemti Secretary General of the International Council on Archives began his remarks as follows This is a fantastic day in the history of archives These are just a few statements from the many professionals who have visited Seville to study the project UNESCO itself supported the organization of two information workshops on the project for Latin American professionals The International Council on Archives backed by the Council of Europe has promoted the Seville model in computerizing the Komintern archives in Moscow Lessons of a TenYear Experience It has been 11 years since the project was launched by an agreement between the Ministry of Culture under which the AGI operates the Ramn Areces Foundation and IBM Espaa This is a very long stretch in the changing world of new technologies where everything quickly becomes dated and obsolete It is enough time for us to assess with some perspective a project that has been the most important ongoing effort in applying new digital technologies to the treatment of historical archives44 There is an additional advantage in undertaking this analysis because of its continuity all phases of the project can be analyzed from conception to operation and consolidation Over those nearly 11 years the system was designed developed and installed at the AGI Today the system is a fundamental part of AGIs operations and its use has been established among researchers and staff In addition many steps have been taken to update the system and solve the problems posed by rapid technological obsolescence Range of Achievements The AGI computerization project has made several advances in the application of new technologies to archives No historical archive in the world today can claim a greater variety of achievements Eleven million pages are available for direct onscreen consultation supported by a spectacular combination of imageenhancing tools More than 30 percent of consultations at the AGI are done electronically All descriptive information is available electronically forming a unified data system into which all traditional finding aids have been integrated following their retrospective conversion This entire integrated system is in daily operation in the Reading Room Initiation of the project required identification discussion and analysis of the many problems and the possibilities offered by new technologies Only then was it possible to develop a complete system for managing historical archives with special emphasis on the latest aspects of image treatment But the most remarkable aspect of the project is that the system has been functioning for almost five years During this time staff have had to address the daytoday practical problems of operation including staff training aging equipment and above all obsolescence of hardware software and data media The AGI is a laboratory where an integrated computerized system responsible for most of the functions of a historical archive can be observed operating in real time Project Origin To understand the projects aims methodology and results it is worth noting the circumstances leading to its inception Why was such an ambitious and massive project undertaken Why is this project unique in the oftenneglected field of treatment of historical documentation being carried out in Spain The main impetus for the project was Spains celebration of the fifth centenary of the discovery of America which culminated in the Worlds Fair in Seville in 1992 For several years before the celebration cultural entrepreneurial and political agencies had been encouraged to consider ways to take advantage of the possibilities offered by such a significant public event The Archivo General de Indias offered an excellent stage for activities relating to the commemoration For more than a century researchers from all over the world have been drawn by its stacks of documents of basic interest for studying the discovery and the history of the Americas Accordingly in 1986 three organizations agreed to carry out the computerization project at the Archivo The organizations included a public institution the Ministry of Culture under which the AGI operates a nonprofit private cultural institution Ramn Areces Foundation and a computer technology company IBM Espaa This publicprivate partnership was critical for securing the heavy investments needed by the project and gave all participants increased visibility for their support of an important cultural activity Project Characteristics The project was designed to apply the latest computer technologies especially digital imaging to the treatment of historical archives in support of the AGIs goals of preservation and access The project set specific dates for completion and the reporting of results requiring that by 1992 a system be installed and operating Thus the system already incorporated a large volume of data when it opened rather than appearing as an empty container to be filled The project was aided by the participants commitment to support cultural activities This meant that financial resources were allocated for project development and that staff from the three institutions would collaborate closely over several years The project was intended to serve as the pilot project for the eventual computerization of all Spanish national historical archives Project Challenges The work involved the use of new developing technology especially in image treatment and information medium Challenges included the rapidity of technical developments lack of standards high cost and risk of obsolescence The AGI had no experience in the use of the new imaging technologies The project required large investments because of the high cost of new technologies The costs did however decrease considerably over time Certain technological decisions had to be put off as long as possible to present a stateoftheart system in 1992 The project had to progress simultaneously in system design and development and in massive data entry so that by 1992 the project would be operating at the AGI and a large volume of digital information would already be available The project had to remain within the scope of what was practical given the available resources Importance of Results for Conservation and Access AGI now provides more than 30 percent of document consultation service through digital images eliminating handling of the original and offering significant advantages for both access and conservation The average time that researchers need to conduct their work is much less than before There are more researchers but they complete their work sooner and therefore need to spend fewer days working in the Archivo The Archivo General de Indias and the Global Village The future incorporation of digital holdings into communication networks which also requires careful analysis could make the Archivo General de Indias the first historical archive in the world to offer the researcher such a large collection of material by remote access The emerging global village makes this desirable but its impact on small institutions should be carefully studied to ensure appropriate aims means and results REFERENCES 1 Hans Rtimann and Stuart Lynn Computerization Project of the Archivo General de Indias Seville Spain A Report to the Commission on Preservation and Access Washington DC Commission

effective to December 1992 Textual data entry began in 1988 and digitization of documents in 1989 The first version of the usermanagement module was installed in mid1988 The complete system was installed on a trial basis in 1991 and officially inaugurated on October 6 1992 At the conclusion of the initial project a new agreement was signed covering 1993 and 1994 Background Founding In 1781 King Carlos III decided to found the AGI at the urging of his Secretary of the Indies Jos de Glvez The goal was to gather at one site all the documents concerning Spanish administration in the Americas and Philippines The original documents were to be used as source material for writing a new history of the Spanish presence in the Americas The new history would respond to some of the histories being published abroad that Spanish officials and intellectuals feared were auguring a new episode of the antiSpanish black legend66 The move would also free up space at the Simancas Archivo the central archive of the Crown since the sixteenth century which was then so overwhelmed it could not offer proper service Documentary Holdings The first shipments of papers from Simancas arrived in October 1785 forming the initial core of the AGI They would later be supplemented by new transfers especially from Madrid and Cdiz Today the AGI holds about eight kilometers of shelving containing more than 43000 bundles of original papers These documentary holdings are drawn from the metropolitan agencies responsible for colonial administration primarily the Consejo de Indias Council of the Indies Casa de la Contratacin House of Trade State Secretariats responsible for Indies affairs and the Consulados Boards of Trade of Seville and Cdiz as well as other agencies Organization of Holdings The AGI was provided with an excellent series of Ordenanzas ordinances promulgated by King Carlos IV in 179077 Among other functions these Ordenanzas established what eventually came to be known as the principle of provenance This principle obligated the Archives to keep together all the documents generated by each agency88 without mixing them with the documents of other agencies99 Article V of the Ordenanzas reads The first division of papers should be into collections corresponding to the remitting offices Thus those from Simancas Va Reservada and each of the offices of the Consejo should remain together and be maintained separately from the others1010 Although this obligation was observed for the most part trends in the history of the AGI eventually led to the current organization of documents into 15 sections that usually but not always hold all the documents of a unique generating agency More detail on this organization is given on p 12httpswwwclirorgpageid2254 Finding Aids During the first few years of its history the AGI made a great effort to organize and describe its holdings in order to create a general inventory1111 Although this general inventory was never completed the AGI today has many guides inventories catalogs and indices that make it possible to control the holdings and facilitate access to the information Some of the old inventories painstakingly drawn up at the end of the eighteenth century have continued to be useful in their manuscript format The AGI Building The AGI is located in the old building of the Casa Lonja de Mercaderes Commodity Exchange of Seville constructed between 1583 and 1646 as a meeting place for dealers who traded between the metropolis and its colonies The building was renovated to serve as the headquarters of the AGI at the time it was founded Besides being a Spanish historical monument1212 the site has been declared part of the World Heritage by UNESCO Consultation of Holdings The AGI is visited daily by an average of 50 researchers More than 900 different researchers visit each year Half come from outside Spain almost 40 percent of all researchers come from the Americas The AGI fills requests for 300000 to 400000 copies on paper and microfilm each year and responds to almost a thousand written requests annually Restoration Laboratory The AGI has a restoration laboratory to handle its conservation problems All papers are more than a century old and some are 500 years old with a concentration in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries The documents have been affected by different storage conditions Many have also undergone the vicissitudes of a long Atlantic crossing although great effort was made to ensure optimal packing for shipment In some cases the papers and ink themselves have caused degradation For example the Philippines Audiencia often used fragile rice paper for documents In recent years documents have been excessively handled in the Reading Room Microfilm Service The AGI also contains a small microfilm laboratory which because of staffing limitations generally only fulfills researchers requests for copies However a policy of backup microfilming and microfilm editions has gradually been adopted over the years so that about two million frames in unperforated 35 mm rolls are currently available1313 REFERENCES 5 The General Bibliographyhttpswwwclirorgpubsreportspub76bibliography lists useful titles about the AGIs history and holdings 6 According to Juan Bautista Muoz founder of the Archivo In order to fulfill these worthy purposes to silence once and for all our many fiery defamers and rivals and to show their ignorance to be inexcusable it was necessary to go to the root of the matter to the sources and study irrefutable documents as if nothing else had been written and published Juan Bautista Muoz to the Secretary of State of the Indies Jos de Galvez 28 November 1783 Archivo Histrico Nacional Diversos 29

8 This principle identifies the fonds an archival concept widely used in Europe The ISADG standard defines the term as the whole of the documents regardless of form or medium organically created andor accumulated and used by a particular person family or corporate body in the course of that creators activities and functions 9 The principle of provenance is understood today to include not only the separation of documents generated by each agency but also the conservation of their original order French archivist Natalis de Wailly first enunciated the principle in 1841 as respect de fonds The Germans then developed the Strukturprinzip which later became part of the principle of provenance The Ordenanzas clearly expressed this principle in 1790 even though the terms had not yet been developed 10 Ordenanzas Article V 11 Ordenanzas Article XXVII 12 The site was declared a national monument by Royal Decree on April 20 1983 and a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1987 13 The list of AGI documents available on microfilm through the Document Reproduction Service of the Ministry of Education and Culture is contained in the Boletn de Informacin del CIDA Centro de Informacin Documental de Archivos n 1 1993 Project Objectives The goal of the project was to design develop and implement in the AGI an automated data system capable of integrated management of the most common functions of a historical archive The system was intended to offer solutions to the accessconservation dichotomy that is a central concern for any archive The goal of producing the automated data system was to be met through a series of more limited objectives which can be divided into two major stages The first extending from 1986 through 1992 involved design development massive data entry and system installation The second beginning in 1993 was the phase of actual operation staff training consolidation solution of obsolescence problems and progress toward new standards Stage I Objectives 19861992 To design and develop the system according to the Archivos needs using the latest technologies in databases and digital imaging To undertake massive data entry so that by 1992 the AGI would have in use not only a system but also abundant information including both the descriptive information necessary for document location and the digital images To retrospectively convert descriptive information derived from the AGIs inventories catalogs and indices Such conversion also had to incorporate the more detailed descriptions that were compiled for the documents to be digitized To scan for digital images 10 percent of the AGIs holdings about eight million pages To implement the system once it was developed and put it into service To introduce some parts of the system into other archives specifically the usermanagement module which became the first byproduct for use elsewhere In 1992 the initial objectives were met the system was installed at the AGI and a new phase of consolidation expansion and updating was begun Although a twoyear extension of the agreement among the sponsors made it possible to continue and improve upon what had already been done the AGIs objectives changed It now had the job of assuming direct operation of the system integrating the system into daily operations training staff and bringing on technicians finding new sources of financial support and preparing strategies for equipment update and data migration This was to be done independently without the external oversight of the sponsors Stage II Objectives 1993present To make the system operational in the AGI integrating the daily routines and functions including reference service Reading Room management and documents service The new tasks of digitization and entry of textual data would also be part of the daily work along with other common duties such as restoration and microfilming To become independent of external support from the institutions collaborating in the project and to obtain the necessary resources and make changes in staffing such as bringing in qualified new personnel and retraining existing staff To review and solve problems caused by rapid technological obsolescence taking the steps needed to adapt the system to new computer advances To progress toward more open and standard formulas some of which did not exist at system startup so that the future exchange of data and the migration to new generations of hardware and software would be easier To address the lack of backup copies of optical disks This problem had been put aside until inexpensive effective alternatives appeared in the market To continue and if possible expand the work of generating descriptive information and digital images of documents To begin to locate the system within the current framework of communication networks When the project was started the possibility of remote access was analyzed but use of the Internet was still very limited The following sections provide detail on the system and subsystems that were developed to serve the AGI General System Architecture The system was designed in modular form based on the idea of distributed processing and clientserver architecture This was done to ensure flexibility for future use of the system in other larger or smaller archives and took into consideration future access options through networks Figure 1assetsimagesreportspub76figure157d70f800b879gif quotfigure1gifquot Figure 1 General Scheme of System Operation Fundamental System Modules From the users standpoint the system consists of three modules each of which covers a different group of functions The information and reference system provides descriptive information that gives the user all of the tools needed to find original or reproduced documents It is not simply an index or database providing access to digitized information It is a unified global system of information valid for all descriptive information in the Archivo It includes data contained in all the inventories catalogs and indices produced over the AGIs history It also includes the information necessary to recover digital images of the documents The digital image storage system offers the tools needed to consult digital copies on the monitor or on paper The system handles two independent processes document digitization and its storage on optical disk and access to digitized images for consultation User management includes all of the functions relating to the retrieval of AGI documentation through both manual and automated consultation Tracking research requests researchers files topics of investigation statistics on use and user profiles Monitoring Reading Room use Controlling document movement within the Archivo Controlling reproduction service for researchers General Architecture To handle the series of functions outlined above and to meet the aims for flexibility the system consists of various subsystems Each subsystem comprises a series of logically related functions that are carried out within their corresponding operating environments Different servers provide the main functions in communication with the several workstations These subsystems are as follows The textual database deals with operation of the information and reference system It includes the data entry and consultation processes Digital image storage provides the resources for consultation of digital surrogates It includes the processes of digitization and consultation The usermanagement database permits control of the operation of archive and system consultation The liaison interface provides the necessary communication with the other subsystems The user interface facilitates user dialogue at the client station It converts user inquiries into messages sent to the corresponding subsystem and converts the messages received into easily intelligible replies The printing subsystem allows for printing textual information and digital images Information and Reference Subsystem The information reference subsystem which provides access to descriptive information and thereby to the content of the Archivos original documents is the heart of the entire system It was designed to meet the objectives outlined on p 1515 Description at the AGI The AGI is a historical archive organized according to traditional archival principles which differentiate the archive from the library or the documentation center Its organization is further specified in the principle of provenance noted on pp 56 Most of the AGI is organized according to this principle of provenance The first division consists of sections that usually contain the papers of a single producing agency or unit thereof The sections may be divided into subsections especially Section V Government which is organized into subsections according to the territorial organization of the several Audiencias and Viceroyalties The sections in turn are broken down into series sometimes redivided into subseries containing those documents produced by the corresponding agency in the exercise of each of its functions The series are made up of documents or files grouped into bundles The resulting hierarchical and multilevel model of organization is shown below Figure 2assetsimagesreportspub76figure2gif quotfigure2gifquot Figure 2 Organizational Model of Holdings in the Archivo General de Indias Finding Aids The 1790 Ordenanzas also mandated the formation of various finding aids that would provide physical and intellectual control of the AGIs holdings and the necessary lines of access to the information The ultimate objective was to compile a complete and systematic general inventory of all the organized holdings of the Archivo1414 This work program prefigured to some extent what we now call an information system In practice the archival description consists of individual finding aids such as guides inventories catalogs and indices Although the systematic general inventory mentioned in the AGI Ordenanzas is not complete these independent instruments aim to project a complete and systematic vision consistent with the hierarchical structure of the holdings The characteristics of archival description are as follows It is multilevel including descriptions or entries of various archival units or groupings considered on their several levels collection series subseries file and document It reflects the hierarchical familytree structure of archive organization in which archival units or groupings are included in others at higher levels and may in turn include others at a lower level For the description of each document or piece to be wholly meaningful and fully intelligible it must relate to the higherlevel units of which it is a part and ultimately to the agency producing the documents The principle of provenance thus becomes not only the basic norm for document organization but also the essential element for attaining intellectual control of the holdings and for guiding information access1515 This indirect access to information is supplemented by indices leading directly to the subject person and place But the indices are generally auxiliary or complementary to the principal finding aids This means that not even access through indices is totally direct the inventory or catalog must be located first to use its auxiliary index Accordingly over the two centuries of AGI history numerous finding aids have been developed and occasionally published a general guide to the Archivo1616 inventories for each section1717 catalogs of certain subjects or series1818 and indices Many changes in personnel goals and criteria relating to the work have taken place since the AGI was founded Consequently there are great differences among the various finding aidsin format depth of description level of detail and terminology There are manuscript instruments such as inventories for the Sections of Patronato relations of the Kings with the Church Contadura General Accounting Contratacin House of Trade or House of the Indies Justicia Justice typewritten texts such as the inventories for the Sections of Gobierno Government the papers of the Council of the Indies and the Secretaries of State Ultramar the nineteenthcentury central agency for the colonies printouts such as the inventories of Consulados Boards of Trade from Seville and Cdiz or Correos the Post and some catalogs of maps and plans loose file cards catalogs of Registers and bound volumes In some cases individual documents are described eg Patronato inventory while in others only information at the series level is covered eg Government Section inventories The elements of description used also vary considerablyfrom the title reference number and end dates used exclusively in many inventories to the detailed description appearing in catalogs such as the Catlogo de Consultas del Consejo de Indias or the Catlogo de Pasajeros a Indias Some catalogs and inventories include supplemental indices while others do not The indices themselves are diverse and do not conform to any established norm Some contain long headings that virtually summarize the referenced document for example supplemental indices for the Contadura or Contratacin sections other indices are simpler including only the indispensable data Some cite the document reference number others the corresponding page of the principal instrument and still others for publications a consecutive number identifying each entry or individual description In short there is a wide range of finding aids with different objectives formats and criteria A study conducted before the retrospective conversion tasks were begun estimated that all of the finding aids totaled 25000 pages Many of them however were not available for use by researchers in the Reading Room Objectives for the Information and Reference System To construct a database containing valid information for locating digitized documents and to evolve a unified global system of archival information that could handle all descriptive data of the AGI in an integrated manner All the traditional finding aids would have to fit within the new system so that the entire process of description and search for information could be integrated and automated This unified system is to some extent consistent with the aim of a general inventory set forth in the Ordenanzas To include in this unified system the information needed for better retrieval of the images of digitized documents Such data would not be independent but an integral part of the system as a whole Yet a considerable effort would have to be made to supplement and enhance the description of that documentation with a view to better results and more rapid retrieval To undertake complete retrospective conversion of the large volume of guides catalogs and indices that had been developed despite their errors and lack of standardization To ensure that the new system respects traditional archival principles and the principle of provenance in particular This meant organizing the descriptive information according to the organicfunctional structure of the fonds which calls for a hierarchical and multilevel model of data access In addition to allow direct access to the information through the use of keywords as an alternative to access through the hierarchical path To offer vocabulary control options for the future although the AGI traditionally had no standardization or control for retrieval vocabulary subject headings thesaurus control of authorities To simplify integration with the usermanagement and image modules by incorporating all necessary elementssuch as data access controls and references to new mediainto the information and reference system Outline of Information and Reference System Given these objectives the information and reference module was designed to construct a unified data system that would make it possible to access information through the principle of provenance path while also providing new possibilities for direct data access through new technologies Data Access by the Principle of Provenance Path The system manages relational model databases to set up a hierarchical and familytree model of all descriptive information that is fully consistent with the AGIs organicfunctional structure Following this framework one can navigate from the root or holding institution the Archivo through its several branches to its leaves documentary units or pieces Holdings are organized by level which may or may not be fully reflected in the finding aids The information system should allow management within this structure of existing or described real levels This is not a rigid information structure with preestablished levels The system allows the inclusion and management of as many levels as may be considered necessary depending on the requirements and holdings of the archive The International Standard Archival Description ISADG reflects this approach stipulating in rule 23 that the system of organization and access to information should link each description to its next higher unit of description if applicable and identify the level of description But this standard which was adopted some time after the AGI computerized system was developed does not specify a means for its implementation1919 The AGI information and reference system employs a simple procedure if each descriptive entry at whatever level has an identification code only the code of the next higher unit in the hierarchy needs to be included in the database table to link both units Since the user ordinarily does not know the internal identification code and it is also difficult to remember the Reference Number or code of each description unit is used for the purpose Thus this operation in the data entry process introduces a new element of description that is always necessary the Reference Number or code of the higher hierarchical unit During consultation the user has the option of going to a higher or lower hierarchical level The descriptive entry corresponding to a section will indicate its component series or a document will show all the levels above it Direct Information Access AGI Indices The principle of provenance which provided the main means for access to information at the AGI is an indirect method of obtaining materials Document access is indicated by the path search subjectproducing institutioninventories and catalogssupplemental indices rather than by the more direct subjectdocument route To provide points of more direct access the AGI developed indices to supplement the principal finding aids The indices represent document content through different notions or concepts organized in the form of index headings They may be direct index headingdocument or indirect index headingcorresponding heading in its inventory or catalogdocument In recent years efforts have been made in the archival field both nationally and internationally to create standards for indices production For example the International Council on Archives ICA through its Ad Hoc Commission on Descriptive Standards has drawn up an International Standard on Authorized Archival Headings for Organizations Persons and Families ISAAR CPF which was adopted in Paris November 1520 19952020 Also the Bureau of Canadian Archivists through its Planning Committee on Descriptive Standards published several related textssuch as the Subject Indexing for Archives Ottawa 1992that contain bibliographies and references to existing standards2121 The AGI had no vocabulary control In the planning phase there was discussion of whether to use existing indices or to revise them Revision would require the preparation of strict rules of control or a thesaurus or list of subject headings Project staff agreed that it would be impossible to revise the indices properly within a reasonable time Within the framework of the digitization project it was impossible to draw up a complete list of acceptable headings valid for all sections and all levels of the AGI The differences and incongruities among existing indices were too great Thus existing indices were used with no vocabulary control in the strict sense In the process of retrospective conversion they were converted to the actual keywords that provide direct access to the information An important area of work for the future could be to establish some kind of controlled vocabulary employing for the first time lists of all index headings used in the AGI now available as keywords in electronic format Figure 3assetsimagesreportspub76figure3gif quotfigure3gifquot Figure 3 Means of Access to Information Keywords Keywords are the principal means for direct retrieval of information from the system They may consist of one or more words providing they do not exceed 120 characters They include indices by name toponym institution and subject These keywords can be interrelated by means of precoordinated indexing When a unit of description is indexed two different keywords may be linked by means of a specific relationship such as nature affiliation title or activity For example First Keyword Relationship Second Keyword Pizzaro Franciso Born in Trujillo Cceres Corts Hernn Title Marqus del Valle Coln Diego Son of Coln Cristbal Glvez Barnardo de Activity Gobernador de Luisiana They may also be qualified by the function they perform within the corresponding document For example one person is the otorgante giver of the last will the witness in a judgment or the receiver of a letter The name of the person is the keyword which can be qualified with the function of otorgante witness sender or receiver In the process of consultation if one or more search words are introduced the system will show all of the keywords in the database that contain those words making it possible to locate the descriptive information about a particular document or series of documents For each descriptive entry all keywords considered useful may be included with or without specific relationships or functions Although there is no compulsory vocabulary control the system has the capacity to use a thesaurus as an element of support and consultation It is also supplied with a specific profile of responsible vocabulary control unit which can carry out revision functions such as the elimination and creation of keywords elimination and creation of specific relationships and transfer of references between keywords and relationships Elements of Description Once a decision had been made on the structure for the unified system of information and the major means of access to documents it was necessary to select the various elements of description title content summary volume date spans etc to ensure adequate gathering of all information concerning AGI documents This was some years before the EAD Encoded Archival Description was developed Certain existing possibilities were studied including the MARC AMC format but it was decided to choose something simpler adapted to the AGIs specific needs At the time there was no internationally recognized standard for archival description although Canada Britain and the United States had developed some national standards2222 In 1992 International Standard Archival Description ISADG was proposed to the professional community at the International Congress on Archives held in Montreal It was subsequently adopted by the Ad Hoc Commission at its Stockholm meeting January 2123 19932323 Consequently a data structure was developed that consists of 30 elements of description divided into three areas basic information descriptive information and elements of retrieval The main data are summarized below A numeric label identifies each of the several elements Basic Information Area All of the elements contained in this area are required although during data entry most can be included as values by default These elements include the reference number dates title and reference number of the preceding element in the hierarchy Almost all of this corresponds to the Identity Statement Area of the ISADG standard although additional elements needed for service are also included Descriptive Information Area This covers a series of elements of description that are optional although some are used in almost every case while others are used for specific documentary types These descriptions are usually in a freetext format Examples of the elements are the content summary old and new reference numbers site of issue and internal and external characteristics Elements of Location Retrieval or Access These are the elements facilitating access to the data including the keywords and their several supplements such as specific relationships and functions Also included are such elements of retrieval as the old card numbers or those in other media additional dates to focus searches and so forth Initial Content Retrospective Conversion of Finding Aids At the beginning of the project two distinct possibilities were studied regarding the initial content of the information and reference system To incorporate only the descriptive information necessary for retrieval of those documents included in the digital image storage system or To incorporate all information contained in the AGIs finding aids that is inventories catalogs and indices whether printed typed or in manuscript In the first case a database structure could have been designed that was appropriate for the documents to be digitized In addition efforts could have been made to produce a more precise description of only a subset of AGI documents determining the fields necessary for each document type The second option which was the one ultimately chosen was a new venture entailing considerable risk there was no previous experience to serve as reference since no archive had yet undertaken a similar operation The problemsthe quality of existing descriptive information different levels of description lack of uniform criteria and standards over time and different formatsposed several difficulties A complete list was made of all the finding aids to be converted estimated then at 25000 pages The content and format of each was analyzed and priorities were established for the subsequent work to be undertaken in phases Finding aids essential in forming the complete hierarchical structure of the database were assigned priority Within that group special emphasis was placed on finding aids favoring preparation of the material to be digitized for example that included in the Patronato Section all of which would be computerized Priority was then attached to all catalogs and indices describing certain resources or series in detail and in depth IBMs Personal Editor was adapted for the work to provide plain data entry screens consistent with the needs of each of the finding aids to be recorded The data were stored in simple flat ASCII files with identification codes or labels for each of the fields employed and with control words adding information needed at the time of data entry Two work groups were organized Finding aids published or properly prepared and structured in typescript were keyed in by personnel with no specialized archival background but with data entry experience The finding aids most difficult to interpret usually manuscript and requiring more careful review were recorded directly in the AGI by a group with more extensive archival and historical training overseen directly by the regular staff The results of the process can be outlined in summary as follows The idea of the unified information system took shape as a real operating system following an extended ongoing effort Continuity of the project with the same guidelines over a long period allowed successful completion of the original aims The goal was extremely ambitious but it was always focused on doing whatever could be done at the time The decision to go public with a system filled with as much content as possible as opposed to a database structure without content led to acceptance by researchers Based on this introductory information the initial errors and inconsistencies could provide incentive to continue the effort with the goal of gradually supplementing and improving all of the AGIs descriptive information The Information and Reference System Today This retrospective conversion operation has been complemented by a special effort to improve and expand descriptions especially for the digitized documents The AGIs information and reference system currently includes the following breakdown of entries for each of its units of description 37 entries at the section level 440 at the series level 187 at the subseries level 45398 at the bundle level 113936 at the file level 193849 at the document level 61519 entries for passenger lists to the Americas These hierarchical entries have been supplemented by about 400000 keywords to facilitate direct access to specific documents Today we can make some observations on the information and reference system with a view more to the future than the past drawing on five years of service to users and recent developments in both technology and the development of standards Direct and Indirect Access to Archival Information For many years the AGI Reading Room has been an excellent field of observation for analyzing the means of intellectual access to archival information because researchers could use both the traditional means of access by way of the principle of provenance and the direct means through indexes Although it is risky to reach conclusions because there have been no statistical studies in this area certain statements can be made based on daily observation For example it can be said that a researcher especially one with little experience in using archives makes primary use of the direct access system keywords usually ignoring the indirect principle of provenance hierarchical path which is always slower and more tedious Such researchers are often impressed by the easy access to initial data which makes them believe they have retrieved all available information even though only a small percentage of the total AGI has been concisely indexed Richard H Lytle undertook an experiment in this area in 1978 and published the results in 19802424 One of his conclusionsthat the indexing method offered a greater variation in results better and worseis apparent in this connection If indexing is complete it is undoubtedly a rapid useful method for the user If not search results will be poor Clearly this may have silenced a large volume of documents that have barely been covered by a general description and are not indexed But in addition part of the document context information may be lost through exclusive use of indexes It is well known that an archival document is not an individual independent piece but acquires its meaning from the environment in which it has been produced Thus the traditional method of searching continues to be not only valid but essential The complementary use of both methods is today still the best means of access to information The staff responsible for information must therefore guide the less expert researcher Nevertheless one veteran researcher said that he had located in a few days more information than he had found in weeks of work before the new system was installed Information Retrieval Tools One achievement of the project has been to develop a unified system of descriptive information for the AGI But the tools used to build the system now urgently require updating Use of a system of relational database management with SQL was a significant advance when the relational model was still used basically for totally structured information and management situations But today the system suffers from excessive rigidity and not all of the advantages offered by unstructured information search systemssuch as free text full text and truncationshave been used In this regard the information system has lagged far behind and urgently needs updating Standardization Standardization of all aspects of the information and reference system is another crucial issue for the future Standardized description is the first aspect to be considered In the near future it therefore seems advisable to incorporate at least the ISADG standards although they are still a general and imperfect effort They are also far removed from other developments in the field of documentation such as the ISBD or AACR2 It will be necessary to monitor such recent developments as EAD implemented in the United States through the Berkeley Finding Aid Project and supported in the SGML standard It is also necessary to standardize the language of indexing This will be a longterm project for the AGI since no list of acceptable subject headings or indices has been developed The advantage is that the AGI can do this a posteriori using not only international standards in the field but all keywords generated over the course of two centuries which are currently available in a unified automated listing Standardization of other aspects such as the system for querying databases SQL ODBC or Internet access must also be addressed Revision and Updating of Information System Content Archival work consists ultimately of furthering the organization description and understanding of documents Similarly the AGIs information system will require continuous revision updating and improvement regarding both description and access In the process it will be possible gradually to eliminate errors originating in the retrospective conversion REFERENCES 14 Ordenanzas Article XXVII 15 See Eric Ketelaar Exploitation of New Archival Materials in Proceedings of the 11th International Congress on Archives Munich New York London Paris

1980 6476 and 191208 Digital ImageStorage System The ability to view and consult onscreen many original documents through their digital images stored on optical disk is the most innovative and wellknown aspect of the project2525 As noted earlier the AGI has two priorities the sound conservation of original documents and the optimal access to those documents by researchers In 1992 the Reading Room accommodated some 50 researchers each day In 1990 37303 consultations of original documents were recorded and in 1991 37172 Since this is a relatively small archive slightly more than 43000 document bundles such heavy use by researchers and photocopiers entails a serious risk of deterioration of the original documents Between the second half of 1989 and the end of 1992 almost 200 bundles in the AGI were consulted more than 50 times in the Reading Room How could the dilemma of conservation and document access be resolved The best alternative was offered by the systems of document reproduction and the use of copies rather than originals for consultation This leads to an important point that affected subsequent technical decisions the aim was not to replace the original documents with digital copies but to preserve the original better by avoiding its continual handling during consultation Thus the technical specifications for digitization were set to ensure adequate quality for consultationnot to replace the original for all purposes The level of quality had to satisfy most researchers so that originals would need to be consulted only in exceptional cases Digitization Process We can analyze the system of digital image storage by dividing it into two basic processes the process of digitization and storage on optical medium and the process of consultation Digitization in turn can be studied in two further steps the preparation of documents or prior archival work and the digitization itself Selection of Documents to be Digitized Since it was not possible to digitize all of the AGI documents in a reasonable amount of time the first question asked was how to make proper selection of the documents to be scanned The following selection criteria were used Only complete series would be digitizednever selected individual documents This was the first and mandatory criterion Documents found to be of greatest use for consultation would be selected A statistical analysis would locate the documentary series that researchers had most often used The documents selected would cover all territories relating to Spanish colonization in the New World This would draw on the Archivos strength as the basic archive for history of the Americas As a practical criterion the status of document description was also considered with a view to the work of preliminary preparation The final selection yielded a list of documentary series that would satisfy more than 30 percent of users requests The list represented about 10 percent of all AGI documents It was revised by adding some documents held by two other historical archives relating to Spanish history in the New World the Archivo Histrico Nacional AHN and the Archivo General de Simanacas AGS These documents however were not selected by the same criteria as those for AGI The purpose of supplementing the Archivos holdings was to meet fully the goal established by King Carlos III when the AGI was founded that all documents referring to the Indies should be deposited in the AGI A further goal was to incorporate other national archives into the process of technological modernization More detail about this work appears in Appendix 3httpswwwclirorgpageid2243 Document Preparation The documents selected must be properly prepared for forwarding to the digitization room This entails the traditional work of organizing the documents bundle by bundle drafting new descriptions for them or revising present ones placing them properly in folders writing the reference number etc These steps are fundamental in ensuring a subsequent expeditious and successful retrieval of digital images The final step in preparation is entry into the information system of the descriptive data that will eventually enable document access2626 A digitization guide is also prepared a form that includes the minimum information needed to guide the scanner operator in his work and to carry out the subsequent liaison between the textual database forming the information and reference system and the digital images stored on optical disks Digitization Once the documents have been prepared they are digitized From 1989 to 1994 digitization stations were supplied with an IBM AT computer a Rank Xerox 7650 flatbed scanner and an optical disk unitfirst an IBM 3363 and later a Panasonic2727 The scanner could digitize up to size A3 to 400 dots per inch dpi with 256 grayscale levels although the AGI uses only 100 dpi and preserves only the most significant 16 grayscale levels The same routine is followed for each page scanning viewing compression and direct recording on optical disk The entire process takes about one minute per page The documentsbecause of their intrinsic value age and state of conservationrequire careful handling during digitization so no automatic scanner feeding is allowed From 1990 to 1992 the work was carried out by 15 digitization stations working double shifts with a variety of equipment to prevent delays in case of breakdown The number of staff decreased between 1992 and 1994 when the agreement between the three partners ended In 1995 and 1996 work continued with three fulltime and six parttime employees At the end of 1996 the AGI got two new digitization stations each equipped with a Kodak DCS 420 digital camera and HewlettPackard CDWriter 4020i disk recording units This made it easier and faster to complete the work only seconds per page with less risk to the documents Now AGI requires only onethird the staff to achieve the same rate of productivity as with the old equipment The most important aspects of AGIs digitization work are image quality storage support formats and image compression and quality control Image Quality The quality of a digital image is determined basically by two parameters resolution and grayscale How can the AGI obtain a digital image offering quality guarantees for its stated goals In recent years a series of projects have tried to set standards guiding the selection of such parameters and various criteria have been suggested Don Willis distinguishes between archival resolution defined as the resolution required to ensure a faithful replica of the original document regardless of cost with archival resolution at 600 dpi and 8 bits of grayscale and optimal archival resolution defined as the highest resolution economically supported by technology at a given time assuming a balance between cost and quality and adequate access resolution disregarding conservation but focusing on information needs estimated at 300 dpi in black and white2828 Obviously many types of documentation can be digitized each with its own characteristics and requirements2929 Anne R Kenney and Stephen Chapman divide the documents by category text or line halftone continuous tone or mixed documents Each type requires different parameters in principle While some maintain that archival resolution is 600 dpi NARA proposes 300 dpi after having used 200 dpi in its ODISS Optical Digital Image Storage System project3030 Different projects have different goals that determine digitization parameters Seeking complete replacement of the original by the digital image differs from digitizing solely for onscreen consultation or online network access to limit handling of originals Document characteristics also determine the selection of parameters There is a difference between digitizing modern typed documents that are well preserved and documents of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries with bleedthrough from ferrogallic inks or with inks faded by exposure to humidity A suitable balance among costs budget resources and the stated objectives must also be considered Ignoring these aspects while pursuing optimum quality could make it impossible to maintain projects because of the implications for storage and even general systems configuration For example optimal quality is likely to require more powerful processors higherquality monitors and enhanced capacity networks In terms of the AGI project the aim is to obtain reference quality that will allow users to consult the document onscreen or in hard copy rather than in its original form The documents to be digitized are manuscripts from the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries in various states of conservation They may show water spots stains faded ink or bleedthrough They can be classified as continuous tone according to the classification drawn up by Anne Kenney and Stephen Chapman3131 The fundamental criterion is the search for a proper balance between image quality on the one hand and storage and processingcapacity needs on the other Fortunately the costs of storage and processing capacity have dropped steadily making it less expensive to store and process good quality images Technological advances will also lead to the development of reasonably priced equipment that can handle vast quantities of information Several tests were conducted to ensure quality consistent with the purpose and type of documents3232 with an eye to minimizing storage requirements Based on these tests it was decided to digitize at 100 dpi and 16 grayscale levels 4 bits per pixel These parameters are quite different from those used in other digitization projects but are well suited to the aims of the Seville projectto digitize for consultation rather than for replacement of the original The parameters are also consistent with the minimum values recommended in 1995 by the Technology Subcommittee of the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme3333 Based on these parameters project staff decided not to improve images during digitization but to defer that step to the stage of viewing The viewer decides on the use of image enhancement algorithms at the time of consultation This procedure also simplifies and shortens the work of digitizing the operator does not need to make any special decisions regarding image quality which is assumed to be adequate if the specified parameters are maintained The effect of digitization with grayscale on resolution requires further study as noted by Kenney and Chapman3434 Their comments are made with respect to tests that the Cornell Department of Preservation and Conservation conducted on brittle books The impact of digitization with grayscale on the cost of storage time equipment and processors is declining steadily owing to the rapid growth of processing capacity Color Images The project also aimed to digitize AGIs maps and plans collection which consists of about 7000 pieces that have been extracted from their original provenancebased files to facilitate their conservation These materials differ from other normal documents in that they use color and are oversized Because of this AGI had to use computers with greater capacity and processing speed and new solutions for storage had to be found It was also impossible to use the same scanner as for other materials It was decided to first make a color microfilm copy which would subsequently be digitized Microfilming with Cibachrome at 200 line pairs would yield a goodquality color copy The film could then be digitized with a Nikon LS3500 slide scanner able to capture 4096 x 6144 pixels for 35 mm frames The final resolution in digital form was similar to the grayscale documents 100 dpi with 256 colors For quicker access a blackandwhite copy could be saved The color microfilming was completed but the scanning operation was interrupted and only one hundred digital color images were obtained There were three reasons for this First although the quality of the images appeared basically good sometimes the resolution was too low for sharp text legibility Second it took too long to display the large color document images on the screen with the 486 processors Third this work assumed lower priority after the AGI could offer consultation of maps and plans through color microfilm in the Reading Room Storage Medium Most of the AGI documents are folio size measuring slightly over A4 An A4size image digitized at 100 dpi and 4 bitspixel uncompressed can occupy about half a megabyte While still considered sizeable in 1997 the storage requirement was much more significant ten years earlier Besides needing image compression algorithms there were few choices for media carriers The most useful option was the WORM write onceread many optical disk because of its capacity ease of recording and of subsequent use for consultation and predictable longevity The fundamental problem with WORM disks was the absence of standards and the variety of trademarks and formats which increased the risk of obsolescence A 200 MB capacity IBM 3363 optical disk was used first This disk model on which 1729 bundles were digitized was soon replaced by a Panasonic Reflection Systems RF5010C disk with 940 MB capacity The Panasonic could usually store all the images of a bundle on a single disk after compression It was used to record 3732 bundles of documents Each new RF5010C disk cost 15000 pesetas wholesale about US 100 Thus with 5511 bundles digitized by the end of May 1997 the cost of storage media was very high Assuming that each disk held the images of one bundle and each bundle averaged 1956 pages the perpage storage cost could be estimated at 767 pesetas approximately five cents The process of converting all disks to the new media carrier began with the changeover from the IBM to Panasonic disks The conversion was not completed as of 1997 and the consulting system was still using both types of disks at that time In recent years the use of CDROM has become more common CDR recording equipment has been developed and the cost of blank CDs has dropped Consequently it was decided to migrate to this new format At the end of 1996 the AGI acquired new recording equipment with CDR units and installed six units for converting WORM disks to CDR three to convert IBM disks and three for Panasonic disks Migration has been under way since early 1997 and should take about two years For several years the lack of image backup copies has been a key problem The AGI postponed a decision on the backup system in anticipation of better options such as magnetic or optical tape Meanwhile the AGI had only a single copy of the images risking the loss or deterioration of a disk which would require redigitization of the original A backup copy program was finally established in 1995 Five units were installed for copying Panasonic disks onto DAT DSS I and II magnetic tape 2 and 4 Gb tapes Between April 1995 and the end of 1996 3205 disks were copied leaving only 525 IBM disks uncopied onto a new media carrier These are now being copied directly to CDR in the new migration process that began early in 1997 Now when documents are digitized two CDR copies of the digitized images are made one for use and another for backup The cost of a new CD was 650 at the beginning of 1997 but is now much cheaper By the end of May 1997 the status of migration was as follows IBM disks Digitized 1729 bundles Copied on Panasonic 1186 bundles Copied on CDR 110 bundles Uncopied 433 bundles Panasonic RF5010C disks Digitized 3732 bundles Duplicated on Panasonic 571 bundles Copied on magnetic tape 3205 bundles Copied on CDR 141 bundles CDR disks Digitized 50 bundles two copies Copied from IBM 110 bundles Copied from Panasonic 141 bundles Magnetic tape Copied from Panasonic 3205 bundles Formats and Image Compression The heavy storage requirements for digital document images call for the use of compression formats The AGI wanted to scan for grayscale rather than for blackandwhite or binary images But standard algorithms for color or grayscale images such as JPEG and GIF were not available in 1988 Consequently the AGI digitization project developed its own compression algorithm using a DPCM Differential Pulse Code Modulation model with statistical compression This model allows for an approximate reduction of 2 to 1 without loss of quality The increased use of JPEG made it advisable for the AGI to eventually adopt this compression algorithm Current migration to the new CDR support is also changing the compression format Decompression of the AGI format and subsequent compression in JPEG are carried out during the recording process Since JPEG allows adjustment of the compression parameters to determine the quality sought in viewing the new compression is designed to permit no more than a 15 percent loss The compression factor is similar to the AGI format with the images occupying the same amount of space in both AGI and JPEG formats Quality Control After digitization quality control can be done in two ways The first is automatic by comparing the digitization guide with the resulting optical disk This process can detect mistakes such as omissions and reference number errors that can be resolved before the WORM disk is dispatched for consultation service or before transfer from hard disk to the CD The second means of quality control is manual inspection This can be done by accessing document images at selected intervals such as every page or the first pages of each document or block one page of every five or one page of every days batch of digitized images In practice this type of quality control creates a bottleneck since it must be done by specialized personnel and is timeconsuming It was done for only a brief period at the AGI The users themselvesoutside researchers and staffershave been the ones to detect possible errors such as omissions or repetitions Once digitization and quality control with the first method have been completed the resulting disk may be used for consultation It may also be duplicated and a backup copy made Image Consultation Disk Service In deciding how to place such a large volume of images in service several options were considered Decentralized service would allow users to retrieve the disks themselves but it has several drawbacks These include security risks and the fact that readers need two types of optical disks for each user station There would also be the problem of many researchers simultaneously searching for their disks This option would be more attractive if few disks were involved A centralized strategy called for various possibilities to be studied Use of a jukebox This is the usual solution for centralized service But no single unit could handle so many optical disks and the use of a battery of jukeboxes greatly increased the cost In addition a large space was needed to house them3535 Use of a robot There were no robots available on the market for optical disks only for magnetic tape cartridges One of these could have been adapted but the cost was very high and the risk of obsolescence significant Centralized service with human intervention A users request for a disk would be handled by a human operator located in the Optical Disk Room who would retrieve the disk and place it in the reading unit The use of a set of highcapacity magnetic disks was not studied because they were considered impossible to obtain at the time This option now begins to offer possibilities and its use will probably be justified for urgent requests over the Internet for instance The AGI chose the option of centralized service with human intervention It was the least expensive and allows for the introduction of other options in the future Optical disk servers were installed in the AGI Optical Disk Room connecting more than a dozen optical disk readers for the two existing formats All available optical disks are installed and organized in shelves beside the servers and the optical disk readers An operator at that site handles the requests for images as shown on a monitor displaying disk request messages There are now different servers for IBM and for Panasonic disks It will eventually be necessary to install a server with reading units for CDs When a user at a workstation requests an image the system generates a message shown on the monitor The operator receives the message selects the requested disk from its shelf and places it in an available disk unit The document images are sent through the local area network 16 megabits per sec to the users workstation When all the document images requested have been delivered to the workstation the optical disk may be withdrawn by the disk unit operator who is then ready for the next request The entire process can be carried out relatively easily and efficiently by a single person handling requests through the monitor and a few diskreading units This means that part of the consulting process is not automated and that human errors can occur The time required for sending the images is brief in a minute to a minute and a half the researcher will receive the first image on a monitor and the series of pages constituting the document or file requested will begin to be stored in the workstation Within a short time the researcher will have the entire document From that point on the researcher can work locally for as long as desired Image Consultation When the researcher receives the requested document images on the monitor he or she can begin to consult them using a variety of tools for image treatment and enhancement3636 In the original version of the system the workstation consisted of a PS2 computer with a 486 processor and OS2 operating system and with Dialog Manager and Presentation Manager for user interface These controlled two monitors one conventional VGA IBM 8513 for text and image management and another highresolution unit for image display IBM 8508 for grayscale images or IBM 6091 for color This initial interface with two screens has been modified the subsequent versions carry out all functions in a microcomputer with a Pentium processor and a single monitor The same mix of facilities is retained for document management browsing expansion and rotation printing and the use of algorithms for historical document treatment such as elimination of stains and ink bleedthrough enhancement of faded inks and improvement of contrast3737 REFERENCES 25 Pedro Gonzlez Salas de

the system was devised in the second half of the 1980s it has become essential to start updating and enhancing hardware and software and migrating data The aim of this update has been to incorporate more open formulas free from proprietary influences and adapted to standards subsequently developed or consolidated The other participants in the original agreement have worked with the AGI in undertaking these operations3838 Initial Computer Equipment The following hardware and software was initially installed in the Archivo General de Indias A 16megabitpersecond Tokenring local area network with APPC communication protocol for communications support An IBM AS400 minicomputer with SQL400 as database and usermanagement system server PS2 microcomputers with OS2 operating system as optical disk servers controlling Panasonic and IBM disk units PS2 microcomputers with OS2 operating system and Dialog Manager and Presentation Manager for user interface as workstations They control two monitors one standard VGA IBM 8513 for text and one highresolution for image display IBM 8508 for grayscale or IBM 6091 for color images Digitization stations with IBM AT microcomputers DOS operating system Rank Xerox 7650 flatbed scanners and IBM or Panasonic optical disk units IBM 4029 laser printers for printing images Stations for digitization of maps and plans consisting of PS2 model 80s with 16 MB memory Panasonic Reflection Systems RF5010C optical disk units and Nikon LS3500 slide scanners Current Equipment The system was designed within a proprietary framework with some commercial dependence This has led to revisions of the system to create more open and interchangeable versions Accordingly the initial equipment has been changed over time as the system has been updated The basic changes in equipment have been as follows Digitization stations with Rank Xerox flatbed scanners have been replaced by others consisting of microcomputers with Pentium processors Kodak DCS 420 digital cameras and HewlettPackard CDWriter 4020i disk recording units Digitization continues at 100 dpi and 16 grayscale with JPEG compression algorithm The new hardware allows easier and more rapid digitization This boosts productivity and reduces digitization costs Moreover use of the camera instead of the scanner is safer for the original since there is much less risk of paper deterioration The AS400 database server and PS2 equipment are still used but can be replaced today by any PC with a standard Pentium processor Much of the system now has Windows NT available through ArchiGES and ArchiDOC the rest of the system is expected to run on Windows NT shortly The optical disk and printing servers have been replaced by new Pentium processor microcomputers Similarly the workstationsoriginally twoscreen PS2 modelscan be replaced today by conventional PCs with Pentium processors and standard monitors Six WORM to CDR conversion stations have been added three converting IBM and three Panasonic disks with original diskreading units and Philips CDD 2000 CDR recording units Five DAT DDS II tape units have been added The Tokenring local area network is still in use as are the microcomputers with 486 and Pentium processors The AGI has 40 workstations connected to the network Other Current Equipment Possibilities In standardizing and updating the system it is possible to use several hardware and software options through ArchiGESand ArchiDOC Migration of the entire system has begun for use in operating environments other than OS2 Much of the system is already available in Windows NT while DB2 for Unix can manage the databases Full migration of the Information and Reference and Image systems ArchiDOC to Windows NT and Windows 95 platforms will be finished by November 1998 For the User Management System ArchiGES full migration will be done in the spring of 1999 The system can operate in a standalone workstation or in local area network Ethernet or Tokenring with NETBEUI or TCPIP protocols The system is supported by the DB2 relational model database and is expected to progress to ODBC standard interface for relational databases Several flatbed scanner models can be used for digitization Ricoh Bell amp Howell HewlettPackard IBM and Epson as can the Kodak digital camera DCS 200 DCS 420 DCS 460 through SCSI interface Plans call for the incorporation of new digitization devices Standard compression algorithms have been adopted JPEG for grayscale images with selection of compression ratio and loss percentage and CCITT Group IV for blackandwhite The ISADG archival description standard is used in the information system with freetext consultation to be incorporated in all fields of the standard The development of interfaces for Web clients and servers for the Internet is under way REFERENCE 38 In 1993 during the extension of the initial agreement for the AGI project IBM Espaa and Informtica El Corte Inles the principal Spanish company in the field of computers and connected with the Ramn Areces Foundation decided to establish a new base for the future of the system continuity update enhancement and diffusion to other archives Looking to this goal they signed an agreement to form an association of economic interests officially known as Archivos y Bibliotecas AIE To date they have continued the technological development of the system and installed it in about 30 Archives Centers under the trademark ArchiGES user management system and ArchiDOC information and reference and image systems At the end of 1997 IBM following a general company strategy toward small business withdrew Informtica El Corte Ingls continues to maintain and enhance the system New Prospects LongDistance Access During the years when the Archivo General de Indias computerized system was devised and developed no priority was assigned to longdistance access Instead the emphasis was on development of a system for integral management of the AGI But some prospects for use of longdistance access solutions were analyzed from the start even though the explosive growth of Internet use was still far in the future3939 The initial designs called for an AGI opening abroad through the Data Processing Center of the Ministry of Culturespecifically through the Cultural Information Points PIC the first publicly accessible cultural network The network was accessed through the Packet Switching Data Network PSDN which has X25 lines and the basic telephone network The PIC network disappeared with the arrival of the Internet and the information originally mounted on PIC was moved to the Web site of the Ministry of Culture wwwmcues Today this site includes the Censo Gua de Archivos which offers a database with general information on more than 30000 archival centers and the Bibliografa de Archivos where one can consult the professional bibliography for archives In 1992 a sixmonth experiment in longdistance transmission was conducted by installing at the Huntington Library in Pasadena California a workstation linked to the AGI that provided access to its descriptive database This workstation was supplemented by an optical disk unit located at Huntington headquarters that provided access to the digital image of certain selected documents Thus the descriptive information could be obtained across the Atlantic while access to the digital image remained local Other possibilities for remote connections were studied such as through the Spanish academic network Red Iris Another experiment was conducted to provide access through the Integrated Services Digital Network the necessary interfaces were developed and isolated experiments were done For example at the III Jornadas de Administracin Pblica y Nuevas Tecnologas held in Palma de Mallorca in May 1995 the AGI documents could be consulted directly following installation of a workstation at workshop headquarters that was connected to the AGI network But these experiments were not followed up The massive emergence of the Internet prompted new thinking about the possibilities for longdistance access although the communication networks capacity did not then seem well suited for sending good quality images of the digitized documents A document consisting of 25 pages the usual average at the Archivo for example could require 8 MB Today such technological problems are being solved rapidly making it possible for the AGI to join the Global Village offering its holdings through the Internet But some problems must first be resolved and certain important decisions made Technical Problems The most important technical problems to be considered are the following Finalizing work to provide more open systems or prepare suitable interfaces A decision about the distribution or use through the networks of the specific tools developed for image treatment or enhancement An assessment of the impact of prospective clients and adaptation of equipment to new needs The essential use of broadband networks if it is decided to provide remote service not only for textual and descriptive information but also for digital images of documents Otherwise initial distribution of poorer quality images must be accepted The search for another means of image service bypassing human intervention to avoid initial loss of time if images are consulted remotely Solutions may include the use of jukebox or even better largecapacity magnetic disk sets to provide authentic online use of images This would require another migration of images to a new carrier medium which would be costly in terms of equipment and supplies and would require considerable time to complete Security Problems Opening the Archivos computerized system to remote consultation would require a strategy for addressing security problems which have not been a source of concern so far Much experience has been accumulated in the area of security especially in important economic sectors such as banks longdistance trading industrial research and in the military Problems of Intellectual Property and Document Ownership The finding aids represent an intellectual creation that is the property of the state through the Ministry of Education and Culture Distribution of this information contained in the information and reference system poses problems of intellectual property that are similar in principle to those for any other information whether or not fees are charged Furthermore the document images themselves form part of a Spanish documentary heritage the distribution of which requires careful decision making Should free access be permitted Limited access Who is entitled to access There are several alternatives for distribution Access may be free or a fee may be charged A fee may initially be imposed with subsequent access free of charge Users may be free to further disseminate the information or its use may be restricted to the authorized client Use may be granted only to cultural institutions or individuals or it may be extended to forprofit institutions The usual practice in Spanish archives has been to provide copies of documents on microfilm or paper to institutions and individuals But complete series of documents are almost never provided and in the exceptional cases when they are a special agreement is required obligating the recipient to refrain from distributing copies of the documents Should this practice be continued Or should dissemination be expanded Further restricted Regarding these questions the experience of other centers is still limited There is no record yet of a historical archive putting such a large volume of documents on the network Whatever is done will affect future operation of the AGI and other archives The decision should be carefully considered ideally with the participation of all interested parties Management Problems Certain management problems have already been noted Still the usermanagement system should be expanded to cover the following New types of system access control New types of statistical data retrieval Accounting and billing systems where applicable There are other problems as well minor perhaps but important in the practical operation of institutions such as staffing and work schedules As in other aspects of society today the longdistance or virtual reading room may soon become reality in archives producing the longdistance researcher The Archivo General de Indias could continue to progress in that direction and make a significant contribution REFERENCE 39 Pedro Gonzlez Databases and Long Distance Communication A Spanish Experience Proceedings of the Third European Conference on Archives Vienna 1993 Published in Mitteilungen des sterreichischen Staatsarchives Sonderband 2 1996 31972 Conclusions Multidirectional Progress Computerization of the Archivo General de Indias has been a highly ambitious operation in applying new technologies to archival functions Its achievements in several areas are noteworthy It has affected all areas of work in historical archives management information consultation and conservation showing that it is possible reasonable and ultimately economically viable to undertake this type of integrated archival treatment system It has generated eleven million digitized pages and incorporated all existing finding aids within the automated information and reference system It has allowed experimentation at every point in the process including functional analysis monitoring several years of use in the Reading Room and addressing the constant problems of obsolescence It has allowed continued experimentation in the use of new archival technologies the project was not abandoned at the first obstacle or under the pressure of constantly changing technologies It has shown that the new technologies properly used offer powerful tools for attaining the Archivos primary goals of conservation and dissemination Project Costs Today an analysis of the projects cost between 1986 and 1997 has undoubtedly lost some of its relevance except as a historical footnote In the world of new technology prices of hardware software and media carriers are dropping rapidly while prospects for new equipment are expanding It is almost ridiculous to compare the price of a PC with a 486 processor in 1991 with that of a PC equipped with the latest generation processor in 1997 The price of hardware is halved about every 18 months That said the total outlay has been high During the projects main phase 19861992 the three institutions allocated in equal shares one billion pesetas more than US 66 million The following two years required another 300 million US 2 million This cost covered Research design and development of the system Archival work involved in document preparation Data entry textual databases and document digitization Hardware and software Cost of storage media particularly optical disks The largest item of expenditure has been personnel The technical research and development group has always consisted of at least 10 people and at times as many as 20 The project also required experts in the archival treatment of documents Tens of staff archivists from the Archivo General de Indias the Archivo Histrico Nacional and the Archivo General de Simancas have collaborated on the project along with various groups of contract personnel with greater specialization and experience in such work Finally the project required data entry staff They were needed first for the creation of the textual or descriptive database with a group of seven operators working in Madrid for four years and another team of five in Seville Then they were needed for the digitization of documents with a team of as many as 32 operators in 1991 and 1992 The cost of hardware and software has also been high but has decreased over time accounting for an eversmaller share of the whole And the cost of storage media has been considerable With regard to costs the following observations can be made The important initial work of system research design and development drew on experience gained in other archives and in other projects It represents a significant and at least from the cultural standpoint profitable longterm investment applicable beyond the AGI project Since most of the archival work consisted of the usual activities in archives organization and description of documents it too extends beyond the digitization project per se as does the entry of textual data The cost of document digitization accounting for a large percentage of total expenditures was the most controversial item Up to 32 employees worked together on a job that thanks to technological progress could now be performed with far fewer operators But AGI would have had to wait six years to begin the work and as of today would have had a scant five years of digital image use in the Reading Room Nor would the AGI have enjoyed the other advantages of the system If the decision had been delayed would AGI now be certain that the time had come to do the work Might staff not have decided to wait for new advances to allow more rapid and therefore less expensive work It should be kept in mind that owing to the type of documents involved and their state of conservation automatic scanner feeding cannot be considered which means that human intervention is inevitably a significant part of the entire process More information on actual costs is provided in Appendix 4httpswwwclirorgpubsreportspub76appendix4 Project Results Project results can be summarized as follows The integrated automation of all basic functions of the Archivo The development of a unified data system containing all descriptive information following the retrospective conversion of finding aids The replacement of consultation of original documents by a significant percentage of digitized documents yielding benefits for conservation and access Almost five years of continuous use of the system by researchers in the Reading Room and by the entire staff of the Archivo Important benefits for the management and internal operation of the Archivo Finally a system model hardware software and knowhow available for use in other archives More specifically and in accordance with the initial aims of the project the project has yielded the following benefits for the AGI and for research Conservation Benefits Although digitization does not solve all the problems of document conservation it has greatly reduced the risk of deterioration for about a third of the Archivos original holdings Over the past year 31 percent of consultations at the AGI were done using the electronic document Over the same period paper copies made from the electronic document accounted for more than 38 percent of all paper reproductions delivered to researchers It is reasonable therefore to state that 31 percent of the risk of deterioration from document handling in the Reading Room and 38 percent of the risk from handling to make photocopies has been eliminated Some of the original documents were at especially high risk because of their constant use Between 1989 and 1992 some documents were consulted more than 40 times a year Today the most popular documents have all been digitized and are never handled Appendix 1httpswwwclirorgpubsreportspub76appendix1 provides further details Access Benefits An analysis of consultation figures over the past few years shows that the researcher needs less time today to complete research thanks to the computerized system Information access is more rapid More information is available Researchers complete more consultations per work session The AGI provides more services to a broader range of users Delivery of paper copies is much more rapid See Appendix 2httpswwwclirorgpubsreportspub76appendix2 for more information Benefits for Internal Operation Nearly all functions of the AGI are benefiting from the computerized system Information service response to the user is much more rapid and efficient for both onsite and correspondence consultations Organization and description of holdings the work of description and indexation and the preparation of new catalogs inventories and indices has been expedited Management there have been improvements in tracking research requests monitoring reading room use moving documents and preparing statistics Reproduction service requests for copies are processed and filled much more quickly Final Observations In its efforts of the past ten years AGI has consistently aimed to be practical and has shown that new technologies can offer powerful tools for fulfilling the major goals of conservation and dissemination The AGI has converted eleven million pages and all existing descriptive data to digital format That information is now available for the future It may be transformed adapted and used in various ways but it is there now The use of information and experience accumulated in Spanish archives over a period of centuries also offers guarantees for the future The system was not created in a vacuum but drew upon the entire historical memory of several centuries of archival treatment Technologies change and the system will have to be updated or replaced But in the meantime it will have made a significant contribution in service to a rich cultural heritage General Bibliography General References on the Archivo Gonzlez Garca Pedro ed Archivo General de Indias

though only 12 percent of all documents available at the AGI are in digital form these documents account for about onethird of all service provided by the Archivo This means that about onethird of the risk of document deterioration through consultations and paper reproduction has been eliminated APPENDIX 2 Analysis of Consultation Results For researchers the systems advantages are clear although researchers themselves may be unaware of them They may even be annoyed by surrendering the almost fetishist pleasure of touching the document Still the increased speed of work offsets that loss We can unequivocally say that todays researchers require less time to do their work To illustrate this we can look at consultation statistics in the Archivo General de Indias from 1989 to the end of 1996 Earlier years cannot be used since the system of recording consultation data then differed from the one employed after the first version of the usermanagement module was implemented in mid1988 In addition 1997 was eliminated because the analysis began before the years end and it was not possible to extrapolate data because the number and frequency of researchers visits vary with the time of year and school schedule Increase in Number of Archivo Researchers Table 2assetsimagesreportspub76table257d70f8007d34gif quottable2gifquot Table 2 Researchers visiting the Archivo in recent years The most obvious feature of Table 2 is the overall steady increase since 1990 in the number of different researchers visiting the AGI The spike in researchers in 1991 can be explained by the series of celebrations held in 1992 Many research projects were being completed in 1991 in preparation for the celebrations while for much of 1992 it became very expensive to stay in Seville because of Expo 92 Fewer Reading Room Work Sessions In contrast Table 3 shows a steady drop in the number of work sessions held each year by researchers at the AGI Table 3assetsimagesreportspub76table357d70f8007e72gif quottable3gifquot Table 3 Total number of AGI researcher work sessions in recent years Increase in Number of ConsultationsDay This period also registered an increase in the average number of consultations by each researcher during a work session and a sharp drop in the number of sessions worked by each in the AGI In the years before computerization the average number of consultations per researcher and per day was just over two As of 1993 however it was more than three with fourandahalf consultations a day recorded in 1996 and 1997 See Table 4 based on the results of dividing the number of total consultations each year by the number of visits or work sessions Table 4assetsimagesreportspub76table4gif quottable4gifquot Table 4 Average consultations per researcher per work session Fewer Work Sessions per Researcher Other data show that the researcher spent much less time on average working in the AGI Table 5 shows the progressive decline in recent years in the number of work sessions averaged by each researcher The curve is extremely significant work sessions per researcher dropped to fewer than half between 1992 the last year of manual consultation and 1996 and no other reasons have been found to account for that decline Hours of operation have remained the same and the number of reproductions delivered at the request of researchers has not risen much yet the number of individual researchers visiting the Archivo has increased considerably Table 5assetsimagesreportspub76table557d70f800802dgif quottable5gifquot Table 5 Average work sessions or visits per researcher and year Conclusions The conclusions that can be drawn from the tables relate to the greater facility for research offered by the system more individual researchers visit the Archivo and yet there are fewer work sessions Why Because in each work session the researcher has access to more information and can consult more documents These advantages can be analyzed in two areas ease of finding documents and the ability to consult many onscreen In the first instance the information search is more rapid using the computerized system than using printed finding aids The new system furnishes tools for easier more rapid retrieval of data and much faster location of the original documents needed for consultation The best tools are made available to researchers and more information is provided to users today than was possible with the original finding aids so information is not only easier to retrieve but there is also more information available for locating documents It takes only one or two minutes to obtain a requested document onscreen while it can take several to retrieve the original from stacks and deliver it to the Reading Room Even if the researcher should decide to request a paper copy for subsequent consultation service is still faster While photocopies can be delivered to the AGI within one to several weeks digital images are usually delivered the day following a request or even the same day if service fee payments are expedited In summary there are two key advantages of the system for consultation First researchers need much less time for their work Second while more researchers visit the Archivo they schedule fewer work sessions because they need less time for their research Consequently the Reading Room is less crowded APPENDIX 3 Supplemental Digitization of Documents from Other ArchivesAnalysis of Results As noted in the section on selection the body of digitized documents include a sizable group of papers from the Archivo Histrico Nacional AHN and the Archivo General de Simancas AGS This is supplemental documentation concerning the administration of overseas territories which for one reason or another failed to reach the Archivo General de Indias as ordered by King Carlos III11 There were two main reasons for the decision to digitize these supplemental holdings as part of the AGI project The first relates to King Carlos III original desire to bring together all materials referring to the Indies In this connection the completed operation has been of significant value difficult to quantify but tracing an interesting path for the reconstruction of the archival heritage22 The second aim of this operation has not yet been fully met It was to incorporate other archival centers into the digitization process from the beginning making two digital copies of the same papers one for the AGI and the other for the archive holding the documents As observed earlier in this report the Ministry of Culture viewed computerization of the AGI as a pilot project for computerizing the other state historical archives Were these goals fulfilled Only partially The objective of supplementing AGI resources to make it as King Carlos III had wished an authentic general archive for papers about the Indies has been largely met by incorporating 2189 new bundles in digital form But the aim of incorporating other major Spanish archival centers particularly the AHN and the AGS within the mainstream of new technologies has been only marginally accomplished for example the bundles digitized are not yet consulted in their own Reading Rooms What have been the results in terms of dissemination and conservation Limited because the holding from other archives appear to be of less interest to AGI researchers Table 6 shows that digitized documentation from the Archivo Histrico Nacional and Archivo General de Simancas is very seldom consulted in the AGI It accounts for less than 10 percent of total consultations by means of digital image even though it represents more than 40 percent see Table 7 of the total documents digitized These tables were based on the following data The Archivo General de Indias currently consists of 43209 bundles of documents of which 3210or 743 percent of the entire Archivohave been digitized In addition another 2189 bundles from other centers Archivo Histrico Nacional and Archivo General de Simancas have been digitized supplemental digitization Adding the total figures for bundles 43209 and 2189 45398 and comparing them with the bundles digitized 3210 and 2189 5399 we can estimate that 1189 percent of the total holdings of the three archives have been digitized This 1189 percent is serving 3116 percent of the consultations in 1997 an excellent result Of the total bundles digitized those from the AGI account for 59 percent while those from the AHN represent 31 percent and from the AGS 10 percent In other words the AGI has processed 59 percent as compared with 41 percent for the other two archives However the portion of documents from AHN and AGS consulted through the system in recent years has been only 604 percent This makes an important point regarding selection for digitization Decisions about which of AGI holdings should be digitized were based on an analysis of their use This was not the case with documents from AHN or AGS This drastically affects the results of system use What might the results have been for consultation and conservation is such material had not been incorporated into the digitization process Table

Dordrecht The Netherlands International Council on Archives 1998 12529 APPENDIX 4 Figures for Cost and Production The conclusion of this report stated that an analysis of costs during the main phases of the project has lost much of its relevance except as a historical footnote But it is possible to give some data about the actual cost of implementing the system in an archive to assess whether a project can be economically viable With this goal we are going to analyze a typical case including the acquisition of the necessary hardware and software and assuming production of a significant number of digital images including document preparation scanning and storage The costs are estimated for Spain Equipment and personnel costs vary greatly among countries 1 The Documents We assume that 250 bundles of old documents about 11300 files or 500000 pages will be scanned that pertain to two different series of the AGI Confirmaciones de Encomiendas and Confirmaciones de Oficios These are two series of the AGI that were digitized in the projects main phase Their catalog is included in the information system and a paper copy also exists in the Reading Room Preparation of the documents entails moderate difficulty 2 The Work Archival Work This involves the normal work of archiving organizing describing indexing placing files properly in folders writing the call number and so on Description includes the cataloging of every file Elements include title dates abstract and call number The indexing includes the extraction of the principal key words Textual data of the new descriptions are then entered in the information system and a digitization guide is prepared Repair or conservation of documents sometimes necessary is not assumed in this example Scanning This involves the scanning storage and creation of backup file and quality control by automated means 3 Staff and Production Estimates Archival Work Three fulltime staff per year archival and historical background It is presumed that an archives expert can prepare two bundles per week 45 weeks per year x 2 bundles per week x 3 persons 270 bundles Scanning Four fulltime staff per year scanner operator The average production is 135000 pages per person per year 600 pages per day x 5 days a week x 45 weeks a year This is a conservative estimate If there is no problem with hardware and personnel productivity will be higher 4 The Equipment We assume that a full set of equipment is needed It is composed of an Ethernet local area network with One server with CDR and DAT tape units laser printer Windows NT DB2 or Oracle and application software ArchiGES and ArchiDOC One scanning workstation with Windows NT and ArchiDOC for image capture One textual data entry workstation valid also for consultation with Windows NT and the corresponding application software One consultation workstation with the same configuration One usermanagement workstation with a printer Windows NT and the corresponding application software 5 Project Duration Preparation of documents is estimated to take one year assuming a staff of three archivists The level of difficulty in preparing various documents will influence the time and staffing required for preparation The scanning process requires four years if only one camera is used and assuming one daily shift If there are two daily shifts the time required for scanning will be reduced to two years 6 Costs lttable classquottablequotgt lttbodygt lttrgt lttd colspanquot2quotgtltigtPersonnelltigtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgt lttdgtArchives experts 3lttdgt

Statisticshttpswwwclirorgpubsreportscasestats Introduction to the Public Libraries Communities and Technology Project For more than 40 years the Council on Library Resources has identified library issues and developed new approaches to library operations As a nonprofit operating foundation the Council serves as a catalyst for programs in library leadership development as well as the economics of information and the development of the digital library Recently the Council has been interested in addressing the challenges public libraries face in an era of information revolution and the implications of these challenges for the education of the library profession At the same time the WK Kellogg Foundation has taken a keen interest in the roles public libraries are playing in their communities and how public library leadership is being developed for the future Through its Human Resources for Information Systems Management HRISM program the Kellogg Foundation is developing the leaders who can build and manage the information support systems needed by society and is assisting current library leaders in transforming their institutions in response to changing societal needs A grant to the Council on Library Resources by the Kellogg Foundation established a program to take a closer look at public libraries and determine the most useful avenues for developing leaders building networks within the library and information science communities and strengthening the dialogue among the people who use and support public libraries Within its Kellogg program the Council is gathering information on public libraries that have developed particularly innovative services that use emerging technologies to serve the local community or that have been influential in addressing public policy for information services in their communities The Council will use this information to produce publications intended to encourage and guide library directors and to inform community leaders about the dynamic roles that public libraries and information technology can play within communities In the longer term the Council will use the information gathered about public libraries to guide the development of programs that will enhance library leadership Working with an Advisory Committee of public library directors the Councils staff decided that the best way to learn was through direct communication with library leaders and staff Council President Deanna Marcum sent a letter to more than 3000 public libraries with acquisition budgets of over 10000 to identify innovative uses of technology especially those applications of technology used to meet community information needs This June 2 1995 letter asked library directors to write a paragraph summarizing local programs A copy of the letter follows this introduction The Council received 293 letters in response from public libraries in 46 states all but Rhode Island Tennessee Mississippi and Nevada Responses came from small libraries and large libraries state libraries and regional library networks Rural urban and suburban libraries are all represented A wide variety of community programs and means to carry them out are described The texts of the letters are available on a World Wide Web site at the University of Michigan School of Information httpwwwsiumicheduCLR From among these letters the Councils Kellogg Program Advisory Committee selected 12 sites for further study and site visits In the selection process the Advisory Committee looked for the following models for emulation examples of both large and small libraries projects that have been implemented programs with community impact technologically sophisticated programs successful or significant investments that should be highlighted programs that encourage diversity collaboration among libraries and community organizations and projects that are coordinated and integrated within the overall library program Council staff members visited the 12 libraries to gather information about library technology programs and their impact on the community From the visits and information supplied by the libraries Council staff have written the case studies that follow and an essay that documents commonalities among programs challenges and lessons learned Through the case studies the analysis and subsequent publications derived from this information the Council hopes to provide inspiration and direction to library directors and to call attention to public libraries that are serving their communities effectively The case studies tell only a partial story of what is taking place in public libraries The sample is limited and by no means scientific These 12 libraries represent a very small fraction of the thousands of public libraries in the United States that are using information technology in innovative ways These 12 also are among the libraries that are now predicting their communities future information needs and planning how they might respond effectively By eschewing a scientific sampling the Advisory Committee paid no particular attention to the geographic distribution of sites across the country or to the particular size of libraries even though the selected libraries represent an interesting mixture of urban and rural large and small city and town individual libraries and systems The case studies have been prepared by the Councils staff and in each instance a draft narrative was sent to the library under consideration for review and comment The opinions expressed in the case studies are those of the Council on Library Resources alone More detailed information about the services and systems of these 12 libraries may be obtained directly from the individual library or in most cases from the librarys World Wide Web site Comments or questions about this project should be directed to The Council on Library Resources at the address noted on the inside front cover gt The Council on Library Resources is a nonprofit operating foundation established in 1956 to look toward the future on behalf of libraries address problems experienced by libraries in the aggregate and identify innovative solutions The Council promotes research organizes conferences issues publications and manages collaborative projects to bring about significant changes in its areas of interest It is supported by grants from other foundations and it has recently affiliated with the Commission on Preservation and Access an allied organization working to ensure the preservation of the published and documentary record in all formats The Councils current programs are in three areas important to the future of libraries developing leadership for managing new information technologies analyzing the economics of information services and assisting the transition from the traditional to the digital library The WK Kellogg Foundation was established in 1930 to help people to help themselves As a private grantmaking organization it provides seed money to organizations and institutions that have identified problems and designed constructive action programs aimed at solutions Most Foundation grants are awarded in the areas of youth leadership philanthropy and volunteerism communitybased health services higher education foods systems rural development groundwater resources in the Great Lakes area and economic development in Michigan Programming priorities concentrate grants in the United States Latin America and the Caribbean and southern Africa Twelve Case Studies Analysis Analysis of the Case Studies Dramatic developments are taking place in public libraries across the countrydevelopments that are altering how libraries deliver information and interact with communities As the information revolution sweeps not only across the nation but around the world public libraries have a unique opportunity to harness new technologies to provide resources that were unimaginable a few years ago The Internet as a communications medium and World Wide Web technology are serving as links to bring people and communities together But technology alone is not enough In many regions cities and towns it is the public library that stands as the communitys information nexus With networked communications technology libraries horizons have expanded but also challenges have multiplied The Council on Library Resources which for more than 40 years has identified library issues and developed new approaches to library operations is interested in addressing the challenges public libraries face in an era of information revolution Through a grant from the WK Kellogg Foundation the Council has established a program to study innovation in the use of information technology by public libraries to serve local communities At the recommendation of the Councils Kellogg Program Advisory Committee the Councils staff asked libraries to describe how they were serving their communities through technology From the responses the Advisory Committee selected 12 sites to study Teams from the Council staff visited the sites talked to directors library staff and users and prepared case studies to describe how these libraries are working in and with their communities in the new era of electronic information In this essay Council staff present an analysis of findings in the case studies The Case StudiesGeneral Observations A case study is not a fully documented depiction of an organization These 12 case studies represent the Council teams attempt to capture what they witnessed and learned onsite supplemented by printed and Web information The central theme in each story is the use of technology to expand and enhance the public librarys ability to serve the communitys needs The studies illustrate how a few public libraries have articulated a vision and recruited other parts of the community to join them in providing new opportunities for the whole These library efforts have not been without conflict or pain and their effects are yet to be evaluated for the most part But all began with a vision for the future Most importantly we discovered that public libraries are continuing to serve important community functions but that the future of these institutions is not assured Many variables are at work in the public library sphere including the uncertainties of funding the costs of building and maintaining a digital telecommunications infrastructure the increasing number and variety of information providers within communities the rapidly changing nature of the technology itself and the need for training library staffs and the public they serve Quite fittingly the final years of the twentieth century represent endings and beginnings for public libraries The future of public libraries as we know them today cannot be assumed for the roles they will play in the next millennium are not yet known Moreover these roles may take a variety of shapes and sizessome of which have begun to evolve from the familiar past and others of which have yet to be revealed In traveling to these libraries we learned that there are no universal solutions for using information technology to serve communities or to provide greater public access to information One common denominator however did emerge The most vibrant public libraries look to the community at large to determine appropriate goals and objectives and to partnerships with individuals and organizations in the community to carry out the objectives There are other common components In each example these libraries have leadership with vision common values about open and equitable access to information funding in relative terms to create a new environment using information technologies and communitycentered strategies for making a transition into the increasingly digital information world Beyond these fundamental conditions and values the libraries show a wide range of responses to the challenge of how to use technology innovatively and effectively Each of the 12 libraries has its own story to tell and the 12 stories are as different as the communities they serve But innovation in the use of technology we found is a relative term These case studies feature a sampling of innovative electronic services in public libraries in early 1996 If these studies are taken as a barometer of innovation in service public libraries are only beginning to take advantage of the range of capabilities of networked information technology Serving Communities Serving the local community has been the focus of the mission of the public library for years As long as basic financial support is local this focus on local needs will continue to drive public library services How libraries determine local needs and how they respond to those needs varies widely The libraries we studied are located in communities that range from 15000 to 25 million people Common to all is a commitment by the library to the local community not simply as an organization that provides information but as a cultural and educational center We heard what library staff and management said about their technological initiatives but what we saw was far broader in scope They are transforming their institutions to meet the needs of the future while keeping themselves grounded in traditional community library services and practices In all cases management and staff have positioned these libraries as important community centers They have seen an opportunity to use technology to provide services to members of the community in new ways even through it has meant substantial investments in computers and telecommunications infrastructure software and electronic publications and training initiatives Library services in these cases are offered based on an assessment of community needwhether the assessment was documented through a strategic planning process or less formal means of discovery Understanding community and translating community needs into objectives for library service have placed some of the libraries in a strategic position of readiness to take advantage of funding opportunities as they come along These planning efforts have been meaningful for institutions large and small with or without the development staffs or administrative infrastructure to seek and manage large grantfunded projects We observed that libraries knowledge of the community and proactive planning efforts helped to ready them to use technology to reach new and larger audiences and to address community needs by serving these audiences in new ways Need for Vision Public libraries became ubiquitous features of the North American landscape when Andrew Carnegie donated money to thousands of communities for the construction of library buildings in the last years of the nineteenth century and the first 15 years of the twentieth century The deal he struck required local governments to cover the cost of books and staff Carnegie believed access to books and education would provide opportunities for motivated workers to improve their minds and in the process their economic conditions What would be a comparable contribution to American people today If Carnegie were alive would he connect every home to the Information Superhighway Would he fund one virtual library which the nation could access through the Internet and the World Wide Web Would he invest in communitybased information networks or Freenets Or would he equip libraries to provide electronic information from inside or outside the library wiring the old Carnegie library buildings for tomorrows technology Would he build new branch library buildings to serve expanding urban and suburban populations These questions are not fanciful but are aimed at the very heart of the question about the role of the public library Is it a place where information resides or a conduit for information or both The public library has been and continues to be both of these things and more The debate about roles is important however because municipal or other local funding for public libraries is not likely to increase at least not in the current political and economic climate More and more public libraries must make difficult choices or seek external funds to pay for new programs And the financial requirements for connecting community members to the Information Superhighway are immense As they seek resources library leaders are finding themselves in new and unprecedented relationships with public and private funding agencies of all kinds Public library administrators have to make a clear and direct case for their institutions and they must take the lead in articulating a vision of what the public library can mean to a community in the twentyfirst century The libraries highlighted in the case studies are doing just that The leaders of these 12 possess vision and know how to articulate it Once articulated the vision is implemented and refined by the entire staff community leaders and supporters volunteers and institutional partners Common Values One great advantage of public libraries is their neutrality within communities They are public spaces that offer a place to learn on ones own about any subject and without review by an authority figure The library staff need not be consulted or involved in the pursuit of knowledge unless the patron wishes Carnegie referred to the public library as the peoples university and this conceptualization of the institution has continued in the publics mind over the years The collections in libraries allow for anonymous and unfettered inquiries into all subjects and unlike a school the public library has no predetermined curriculum or pedagogy Individual curiosity and time are the only limitations on the knowledge that can be acquired The neutral space has another advantage It is available to individuals of all socioeconomic groups and all ages The noquestionsasked policy makes it possible for anyone in the community to take advantage of the librarys services The success of some librarycentered community development projects we saw was attributed in part to the neutral and accessible position of the library within the community The principle of open access for all to information has remained a steadfast conviction in the 12 libraries we visited as in thousands of public libraries around the country even when that ideal is tempered somewhat by community standards and budget For the most part all library services in these sites have been offered without charge to members of the community but in those few instances when charges have been levied the services have been offered equitably to one and all This attribute has distinguished public library service in the United States for the last 100 years We observed library managers and staff within the 12 libraries working vigorously to perpetuate library traditions of free and equitable access to information within the electronic environment even though the actual costs of information and access are not readily apparent to the public and have never been free Evolving Roles For decades public libraries have played a wide variety of roles within their communities but the availability of electronic information and interactive communications technologies has enabled them to take on more and increasingly complex roles Public libraries assume roles that make sense for the local communities For example across the nation libraries function as independent learning centers popular materials centers community information centers preschoolers door to learning research centers cultural centers and homework centers for youth Libraries participating in the evolution to new forms of service through technology point out that much of the public has not understood the number or variety of roles the library has played in the past and they point with some frustration to the number of new roles they should and could take on in the digital age if adequate resources were available Library leaders are concerned generally that the expectations of the community for libraries and their own expectations for these institutions are greater than the resources will accommodate In some places librarians have expressed concern that digital library initiatives are usurping disproportionate resources when compared to the full range of services the library provides Other librarians have cast such concerns aside and embrace the future that the digital world seems to be promising Although librarians talk a great deal about the new services they are providing it may be that so far they are taking advantage of technology to enlarge and improve traditional services or to customize services that previously had been more generic In delivering these new or enhanced services are libraries playing new or significantly changed roles within their communities For example in sites we visited libraries have served as catalysts in community development problem solvers for community organizations or coordinators of community information delivery In some communities these roles would be described as merely new names or extensions of what they have been doing all along With electronic information and a community telecommunications infrastructure there are many possibilities It remains to be seen whether totally new roles for the public library will evolve as the technology evolves The more important evolution may be library leaderships own broadening vision of the potential roles libraries might play within their communities At any rate from our site visits we learned that technology is enabling libraries to take on roles and carry out tasks in ways that are more visible to the public and that the librarians themselves believe will be more effective The Challenge of Partnerships Although libraries for many years have joined with other libraries to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of information delivery public libraries have turned to new types of partnerships to help broaden their resource base and reach more deeply into the community What is changing is that these libraries are forging alliances and partnerships with organizations many of which have not until now been central to the workings of public libraries Further these partnerships involve organizations on an operational level in relationships that are more complex and often more mutually beneficial than that of funder and grantee Such partnerships are making new and enhanced services a reality Libraries are collaborating with telecommunications and corporate partners new types of libraries community organizations and agencies schools and others to provide new services increase public access to information and create communitybased information resources The collaborations have helped libraries establish new constituencies and build wider support and even in some cases broaden and diversify the sources of funding The challenge is to find partners who share the vision and who have the resources to invest in that vision The case study partnerships have been dynamic and variedas varied as the libraries sizes and locales In sites we visited these alliances among libraries at regional or state levels have been and are increasingly important to the local library because the cooperative networking training and purchasing projects of these alliances are making information technology more affordable on the local level On our visits we have seen public libraries join forces with their local telephone companies or cable television providers to take advantage of fiber optic network installation Others have looked to nearby universities and colleges for technical expertise and networking experience Libraries have benefited from alliances with local school systems administrations or individual schools In one example the public library has put together an alliance that includes a publicly owned utility company the mayors office a local university and the community chamber of commerce One urban area has reaped particular benefits from a partnership with a large bank and other corporate sponsors a rural library received its first computer terminal as a donation from the local bank Two libraries have partnerships with commercial information system developers to work collaboratively in the development of new or enhanced products for libraries The point is that the partnershipsin whatever form they takehave proven to be advantageous for those public libraries that have pursued them with vigor and diligence and with a certain creative imagination Some librarians not accustomed to forging alliances particularly with the corporate sector have expressed concerns about demands that might be placed on them by the new partnerships Most however have embraced the new alliances with enthusiasm and the hope that the partnerships will increase opportunities and programs Partnerships generally require more work than anyone ever forecasts or readily acknowledges But in looking to the future public library leadership has identified partnerships as a way despite all the uncertainties and risks to make their vision of the future possible Libraries and Communitybased Information Networks Providing information to meet the needs of community members is not new but libraries are working in lessfamiliar territory as they collaborate with a range of organizations to develop a network of information from many different information providers Although public libraries have gathered and made available information about their local communities the public was little aware of this activity until the advent of communitybased information systems delivered in electronic form In addition to simply gathering information many public librarians see themselves as adding value to this information Many are applying traditional library approaches to adding value and information in electronic form Some of the libraries have organized or indexed the information created by other organizations to make it more useful and made it accessible as a logical component of the local library system A few have customized these resources by linking to them from logical places on their homepages on the World Wide Web Many of the sites have carefully selected electronic resources that correspond to the interests and needs of the various segments of the community Other libraries have geared their efforts not only toward increasing public access to this information but toward making sure that the underrepresented and the underprivileged in their communities have the means to access it as well In most cases however the electronic services provided mirror the services libraries have long provided But more needs to be done to take advantage of the interactive capabilities of the technology that will enhance communication and facilitate problemsolving with and among segments of the community Libraries are accomplishing their communitybased goals in many different ways In some instances the library system and the communitybased information system community network or Freenet are not directly connected Although they may serve related or overlapping missions they may be financed and managed as separate organizations This may reflect some libraries placing a higher value on retaining autonomy than on taking the risks involved with nurturing creative partnerships In some libraries the concern is expressed differently They regard alliances with community networks as a kind of social service that should remain outside their realm Thus not every library has viewed its future as tied to the fortunes of the local community network or Freenet But in many places the public library has extended the definition of itself as an information provider and has assumed a new role by adding a communitybased information network or Freenet to its palette of services There is no single answer What has worked in some communities may not work in others The range of types of alliances formed to provide community information are as varied as the communities they serve and the role of the public library within each alliance varies with the style and capacity for leadership within the library Staffing and Training In every library we visited and from conversations with many other public librarians one of the concerns voiced most frequently is that the staff expertise needed to play a leadership role in the digital environment is not readily found among existing staff Public libraries we visited have hired technical experts to join the staff on occasion without a background in library and information science Some public libraries have encouraged current staff to develop technical skills and leadership expertise others still in a few instances have promoted technically proficient staff into key areas of information systems management All of the libraries cited the need to invest much more heavily in staff training Practically every person on the staff of todays public libraries needs to know more about computers electronic resources and working on teams and many will need to learn about fundraising Although part of the necessary learning must be achieved by individual effort the libraries recognize that they have an obligation to equip staff to work in a different kind of environment one that fosters communication among staff at all levels takes advantage of technology and uses staff skills in different ways Some libraries also have recognized that their technical experts could benefit from some training in traditional library functions and activities The difficulty is that training budgets in public libraries have been traditionally very small The need to retool the current staff is huge in comparison to the funds that can be obligated readily to this purpose Nevertheless these libraries are doing what they can to facilitate training even if that means informal tutorials and exchanges of information among staff Training is a priority in public libraries but it may be among the hardest activities to fund perhaps because of the difficulty of documenting and articulating in laypersons terms its direct impact on the services received by the public Since many public libraries are already stretching to acquire hardware software and connections as well as information in electronic form they are not readily finding the resources to support comprehensive training As public libraries become more familiar with technology and its uses and as they expand their partnerships in the community training possibilities may more easily present themselves and may be the outcome of new innovative alliances Nevertheless library leaders need to be able to articulate effectively the need for training and to implement effective training strategies The Need for Buildings and Space Opinions differ even within the library community itself about the need for building or expanding libraries in expensive urban real estate zones especially as the availability of networked information expands rapidly Library staff who see community members seeking human contact in a safe warm place and who provide desperately needed services for the communitys children see clearly a need for physical library space They despair when technology enthusiasts speak glowingly of virtual libraries and the development of virtual communities through the Internet as an alternative If money were not an issue both the virtual and the physical community centers could be fully developed staffed maintained and promoted The case study libraries are both virtual libraries and community centers They support the philosophy that to serve communities effectively today public libraries must be both despite the resulting strain on resources Building and maintaining adequate physical space to carry out library services is an important issue Of the 12 four libraries have completed recent significant main library renovations four others have constructed or will construct shortly new central library facilities and two will go to voters this year with bond referenda for new main library buildings In addition three of these public libraries are building new branches to serve growing suburban or neighborhood populations Library administrators ongoing concerns for sufficient attractive and wellmaintained facilities are exacerbated by the need to wire buildings for network connections and reorganize space for delivery of electronic information At every site technology has required some form of refurbishing and rearranging space Many libraries have established public computer laboratories in their main buildings to provide access to the Internet for allincluding those without the physical means of connecting to the library from home or office Each of these libraries is committed to providing equitable access to electronic information from all library facilities including branches but extending the full range of electronic services to branches is a steep financial and technical hurdle for multisite library systems These public libraries provide or have plans to provide electronic information to people who cannot visit a library building through dialin or Internet connections Not everyone has the means to connect to the libraries electronic services or visit a library facility As a result some libraries are creating partnerships with social service and other agencies and to install networked computers in shelters senior citizen centers halfway houses recreation centers for youth and bus terminals Even in an era of increasing availability of networked electronic information libraries must still confront the problems of space buildings and physical public access to ensure that the gateways to that electronic information are open to all Conclusions In an environment in which technology offers hope for helping society to improve itself it is understandable that library leaders would look to technology to make their institutions more relevant to the communities they serve There is a fortuitous confluence between the services libraries in fact have offered to their communities and the opportunities offered by electronic information and new forms of delivery Several of the libraries we visited have crafted programs that use technology to solve the most difficult problems of the community such as literacy programs that are based on developing computer skills while learning to read or to communicate in English Other libraries have developed special resources for the business community recognizing that the equipment installed for that purpose will also be useful to others for many different purposes There is a difficulty however in that the public libraries most well known and appreciated features have little to do with technology When asked to comment about the value of the public library in the community most respondents to opinion surveys and polls including a recent survey1 and focus group conducted by the Benton Foundation for the Kellogg Foundation HRISM program remark that the public library is the place where all citizens without charge can gain access to information find recreational literature or gather materials for childrens homework But there appears to be a mismatch between the mission of the library that is known and loved by the community at large and the vision of those who know about the potential of the library to serve vital needs of the local community Public libraries in North America are much admired by local citizens and are considered useful educational agencies and important for their services to children The public opinion polls have confirmed this fact These warm feelings about public libraries are found even among that segment of the population that does not generally use the public library And this good will is also a fundamental weakness People think of the public library as a good place for children but they do not think in terms of the financial investment required to make the public library an important information resource in the community Nor is the public library thought about as a leader in information policy The best public librariesand these include the 12 we visitedunderstand that digital technology has the power to create a new or more highly evolved kind of community agency The case studies offered here give insights into how a dozen library directors and their staffs have recognized that technology properly applied can strengthen and enhance a community by drawing in individuals and organizations who have not been part of the librarys family in the past Personality and style differences of library leadership the traditions and history of the institutions and the makeup of the communities they serve are important factors but the common elements among these library innovators are communitycentered strategies for library service leadership with a vision of information technology serving the community the ability to articulate this vision convincingly and a belief that access to information is a fundamental right in a democratic society 1Buildings Books and Bytes Libraries and Communities in the Digital Age A report on the publics opinion of library leaders visions for the future Prepared by the Benton Foundation Funded by the WK Kellogg Foundation Washington DC November 1996 Case Studies Brooklyn Public Library Case Study The Context The Brooklyn Public Library is a cultural icon For decades it has stood as a symbol for bridging cultures races and age groups The library teems with a diverse mix of people seeking business information leads on securing the next job educational computer games an adult literacy class or just a warm friendly place to sit and talk with others A community of 2300664 residents Brooklyn is the most populous of New York Citys five boroughs It is a culturally diverse community where more than 90 languages are spoken Increasingly it is a borough of immigrants 29 percent of the population is foreign born Some 40 percent speak a language other than English at home and for 18 percent that language is Spanish Close to a million people are bilingual or nonEnglish speaking Some 64 percent of the individuals 25 years and older are high school graduates nearly 17 percent are college graduates The median family income is 30033 with 514163 persons living below the poverty level1 Brooklyn Library managers view their institution as a traditional public library and describe their mission as supporting the publics information recreation and hobby needs Within this environment CDs videos and CDROMs circulate cookbook collections grow and a carefully stocked and visually appealing job information center is always busy Staff members report especially high use among senior citizens and children The library reflects the diversity of the population by purchasing collection materials in 60 languages The system provides services at a main library 58 branches and a special business library Also Brooklyn is the only system in New York City that operates a bookmobile In 1994 the library collection included 4655894 items the library circulated 9494209 items and staff answered 6796946 reference questions In 1994 the library received support of 2123 per capita The library is unusual in that it is a private nonprofit corporation an independent organization within the city According to the library director this means that there is no higher body to blame The library must solve its own problems and establish and administer its own policies Accomplishments Although the library has been less aggressive than some other public libraries in adopting new technology there have been some notable technical accomplishments The Brooklyn Public Library has been most innovative in using technology to support individuals learning in formal literacy training and afterschool programs for children In a system in which customized branch services are highly important in serving local needs the library has established a twelvestation computer laboratory in the Flatbush Branch to experiment with open patron access to information technology and Internet resources at the branch level The library has begun to develop a systemwide information infrastructure in a community environment where there are no large commercial or educational organizations identified as partners The library will use a Brooklyn Public Library World Wide Web homepage as a catalyst to network electronically with other Brooklyn institutions Managers are committed to the concept of library buildings as important places for their public A recent survey by the library showed that customers value the space as well Warm in winter and cool in summer library buildings supply a welcome haven for the many people of Brooklyn who live in close quarters Branches throughout the system serve large numbers of schoolage children after school because their parents have come to trust the library as a safe place Technology The new library director Martin Gomez expresses his desire for the library to take a leadership role within Brooklyn but more specifically to exploit the potential of information technology to bring people together to solve community problems The board recognizes that virtual community can be as powerful as physical community Automation is our number one priority the director says We have to promote the theme of using information technology for the benefit of the public This message is often repeated to City Council members foundations local businesses and the library board Many library managers and employees in public service positions talk about his philosophy with open appreciation They express willingness to take on the challenges of the information technologies they have seen and heard so much about Many express support almost relief that the director has lifted automation to the highest priority Articulating widely and often the need for developing an automation infrastructure paid off recently The library has secured 2 million from the borough president and 15 million from the City Council to complete a system upgrade in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 The staff indicates that until the arrival of Gomez in September 1995 the Brooklyn Public Library had been somewhat slow to implement automated library services Technology had been introduced in small steps that could be taken without broadbased administrative support or technical infrastructure several smallscale projects were initiated within a single department or building A few staff members noted however that being behind the curve of cuttingedge technology has the advantage of allowing the library to learn from others experience For example learning from libraries in other boroughs Brooklyn will choose to configure workstations with a different complement of services for different places or purposes rather than expecting a single model of workstation to do everything Thanks to an active fundraising program the library has received several small grants to enable among other things the building of a local area network for the main library purchase of software and equipment for the three literacy Learning Centers and installation of a local area network for the business library Recent grants have enabled the business library to offer a focused collection of print and electronic resources for small businesses and to make reference service available by an 800 number to New York state residents beyond the local telephone dialing area Because efforts to automate have largely been made piecemeal by individual initiative the library has developed several independent systems Over the past few years the library has created a bibliographic database in electronic form and is using an online circulation system throughout the library system Currently the librarys public access catalog is pressed on CDROM disks and made available at public workstations through a Bibliofile system The library is now poised to take the next step of providing an integrated online catalog system at all library buildings The library staff has begun to experiment with Internet access for reference and professional use and the main library local area network will soon be upgraded to allow the public to gain access to the Internet A special grant from the Microsoft Corporation and the Public Library Associations Libraries Online program has enabled the library to offer public access to the Internet at terminals in the Flatbush branch In its plans for other branches the library will emphasize the equitable spread of technology providing a few workstations in as many of its branches as possible rather than concentrating resources in a few branches at a time Learning and Technology Library managers believe it is important to add value to the information they provide by teaching people not only how to find it but also how to use it The librarys current emphasis on developing technology supports one of the librarys highest prioritiesserving learners At the turn of the twentieth century the Brooklyn Public Library was well known for its inhouse English classes for immigrants Today literacy efforts continue to flourish at the Brooklyn Public Library at least in part because the library offers resources and instruction with no value judgments Some 700 students are now enrolled in adult literacy instruction that has evolved from a phonicsbased oneonone tutoring program to group methods that rely heavily upon computer technology Students develop basic reading writing problem solving and criticalthinking skills by using the same word processing database or spreadsheet software that they might find in a work setting Students may sign up to use the literacy computer center any time seven days a week Within a more specialized family literacy program adult learners find out how to select childrens books and use interactive reading strategies to share these books with their children Using this approach adult learners become the conveyors of reading and learning for their children The literacy classes are supported by New York City rather than by library funds The literacy program operates within the Librarys Program Development Office managed by veteran librarian Susan OConnor who says The library really supports education Listening to OConnor speak one begins to understand how a variety of public library services to learners of all ages have benefited from the librarys highly developed experience with innovative educational methods and computer technology that enables learners Another learning program the Kids Connection is an ongoing afterschool public library program for children Science and careerrelated interactive video laser disc programs are being placed in branches where librarians are willing to try something new to provide more effective learning experiences for the large afterschool student population The librarians believe that children enjoy learning and they are determined to place interesting and visually attractive educational materials in childrens hands Within the librarys Education and Job Information Center a series of standalone terminals offers access to numerous job and career databases and related online or CDROM resources Seeing people waiting patiently to be the next to use one or another database underlined how useful a networked approach to delivering the tools would be within the center throughout the librarys facilities and beyond Technology Directions Library management recognizes that technology will not be as effective as it should be unless there is a plan for utilizing it Individual efforts have been useful but they need to be replaced by a systemwide effort In order to ensure that librarywide goals for technology are addressed and that a higher level of technology integration is achieved an office of library systems integration has been established The director of this office Mary Beth Beidl describes the automation strategy as having two phases Phase one is implementing access to a central integrated online public access catalog as well as building a local area network LAN within each physical building that will deliver the same general reference tools to all branches Connections among the LANs will rely on frame relay because little fiber optic cable is in place in Brooklyn Phase two would design a complement of online information resources tailored to each branch and delivered on the branchs local area network The current thinking of library managers is that information resources will be purchased or leased by branches to reflect the language and ethnic heritages represented in the branch population Local content will be developed to serve branch needs but also will be accessible across the branches to the wider Brooklyn Public Library community Each branch will have access to the online catalog and some systemwide resources but also will load resources at each branch that make sense for the local constituency In addition access to the electronic resources will be offered through dialup Beidl emphasizes the need for a plan because the plan articulates the strategy for the vision but she also notes the danger of being too wedded to details Library management believes that technology is changing too rapidly to accommodate the longterm systematic planning to which librarians are accustomed Particularly because the library is behind many of its peer institutions in offering networked information services the librarians recognize the need to seek opportunities to secure external funds that will help the library move forward The timing and sequence of activity may not always be the most desirable from a planning perspective but no opportunity should be avoided or missed The plan can always be restructured if it supports the vision Serving the Community through Branches Library staffs dedication to making each of the 58 branches communitybased is evident and this extends to most branches having their own Friends of the Library group The library profiles each branch for collection development and program development Also the choice of which languages are supported is branchspecific These branchlevel decisions are based on census information although observations between censuses are needed because the ethnic nature of the local communities is changing rapidly The refurbishing of buildings is done on an ongoing basis with three or four of the branches being refurbished at any one time The systemwide plan for technology includes a plan for wiring each branch as it is refurbished City Council members are consulted in making these plans They respond to efforts to upgrade branches in their district and are pleased and responsive when a renovation is finished or technology is installed At the branch level library staff are making new and renewed efforts to serve the community For the Brooklyn Public Library the most visible experiments have been made at the Flatbush branch The coordinator of outreach programs for this branch who was hired with grant funds has made vigorous efforts to connect the library and the community With a community outreach coordinator and a revived Friends of the Flatbush Library more local groups have begun to hold meetings in branch library space Library staff report that the number of library cards issued and total circulation have increased as the number of meetings has increased Full network connections and a computer laboratory with 12 workstations have been installed with a grant from Microsoft and the Public Library Association PLA In the first unadvertised days of availability workstations were always in use with even previously demanding patrons waiting patiently for a chance to surf the Internet and try the networked Microsoft software The effort to bring technology to Flatbush seems more a result of seizing an opportunity than strategic planning Counter to prevailing library philosophies of tailoring collections and services to local constituencies the Flatbush branch has installed a set of Microsoft software the company was willing to give away albeit with some titles in French translation to serve Haitian and Creole populations in Flatbush The relationship to ongoing programs is not strategic but may well evolve with the project The most promising indicator is the excitement exhibited by the community activists for the technology Technical Infrastructure The Brooklyn Public Librarys automated circulation system runs on a Sequent SE30 computer connected to 236 terminals over a lowspeed widearea network The terminals are distributed throughout the central library and the 58 branches The library makes its catalog available to the public on a Bibliofile CDROM system at 250 catalog work stations distributed throughout the branches and the central library A public access local area network LAN in the central library connects five workstations and provides reference databases and indexes on CDROM including newspaper indexes from UMI and Newsbank A second public access LAN will open in the central library in October 1996 with 12 Gateway Pentium workstations providing Internet access word processing and multimedia applications The Business Library has a public access CDROM LAN which connects seven public access workstations and has a remote dialin capability The LAN at the Flatbush Branch has 12 public access workstations Additional LANs are planned for the branches In addition to the networked work stations mentioned above the library has about 30 public access work stations in the central library and 83 throughout the branches 20 are available in the childrens service areas With the exception of about eight Macintoshes they are all 486 machines used to provide reference databases and multimedia applications Periodical indexes and fulltext articles on EBSCOs Academic Abstracts CDROM product for example run on 16 of these standalone workstations in the central library and also in 40 branches The Literacy Program has 25 public access Macintoshes in its training centers The Library has a computer staff training center with ten workstations at the Pacific Branch The Library uses T1 and fractional T1 128KB and 384KB connections to connect from each facility to the local Internet provider By the end of October 1996 the library will have a total of 30 public access Internet workstations with full graphical capability Challenges The staff of the Brooklyn Public Library has a strong commitment to the library as a place It has an equally strong commitment to public service Consequently staff members are eager to provide electronic resources to the members of their community They are less sure about the desirability of making networked resources available to individuals homes They seem somewhat apprehensive about taking any steps that would put distance between the librarian and the user They seem uncomfortable too with any plan that would further separate the privileged and the underprivileged users Thus far at least the librarys leadership envisions that technology will be installed in the main and branch libraries and that citizens of the community will come to one of the buildings or dial in to use it This will further position the library as the public access point for community information Several of the librarians remarked that the changes in use patterns will be monitored closely as technology is installed sequentially across the branches They hypothesize that individuals beyond the normal boundaries served by a particular branch may begin to frequent the library facility that provides electronic access Library managers find themselves making policy on the fly because the world in which they now operate is so different from the printbased world Many decisions are made for them by public utilities vendors or external funders and this breeds a sense of uncertainty not present in earlier days They are also finding it harder to communicate within the system Until now most of the branches have operated relatively independently Managers chose the materials they thought members of the community would find useful Today because providing access without owning the material is a central feature of librarianship they are discovering a certain interdependence within the system Consequently the library staff is forced to improve its methods of communicating across the system In the area of technology purchases the library has uncovered a need for increased standardization and centralized review before purchase The goal is systems integration which means considering the impact of each purchase on the whole library Technology decision making had been decentralized until recently A new office of systems integration should help not only with coordination but also with communication across departmental lines and buildings Library managers also note the need to think differently about hiring new staff Although the MLS degree is still valued the managers realize that many of the technical skills needed are more readily found in young technology enthusiasts The decision to hire such individuals requires a different mindset among library managers It also creates the need for inhouse training that socializes the technical specialists into the profession of librarianship and makes librarians at home with the techies Because the library director recognizes that the institutions success will rely increasingly on external funding he believes it will be essential to add staff people to do development and government relations work Technology training for staff is an ongoing concern In 1996 in a littleused but centrally located branch the library opened a computer technology center The center which includes classroom space and equipment has been renovated for use in staff training The library is using a commercial firm at first for standard office applications and plans eventually to develop inhouse instructional expertise for library applications Library management recognizes that this will almost certainly mean hiring another specialty into the ranks Already the library realizes that technological change is forcing the institution to work differently For example government information which has been a heavily used resource at Brooklyn Public is now being published in electronic form Consequently the Government Printing Office GPO has been a catalyst for technology change Government documents are now available on the Internet as well as on CDROM The staff without significant training cannot fully use or make them available Brooklyn Public is anxious to keep its status as a depository library Since some GPO resources are provided only online via the Internet the library must determine how to make them available even though Internet access is not available in all branches Social science reference librarians long for more miniCDROM changers for viewing census data on standalone workstations so that the discs do not take up valuable space on the main librarys CDROM network Eventually the information will all be online but this method of access requires an infrastructure not now available to the library system The Future The legacy of the Brooklyn Public Library is an important asset for the staff The library has deep cultural and educational meaning in the diverse communities that make up the borough of Brooklyn Staff and management will need to think carefully about the ways that technology can be used to strengthen and enhance the basic mission The social service dimension of the library is not insignificant thus the librarians are for good reason concerned about maintaining the library as a community place Some shifts are already evident With literacy learning through technology the library has moved to very different methods of providing instruction With the main librarys networked CDROM resources and plans for librarywide online access to traditional catalog and indexing resources the library is carrying out the same mission and the same services through new media With the investment in interactive laser disks for children and workstations with public Internet access the library offers new levels of service and takes advantage of opportunity Time will tell whether these latter tools and others yet to be developed will serve the ongoing mission in the same ways as before or open new possibilities for community service The Brooklyn Public Library has strong experience in applying computer software in a learning environment especially through its literacy programs and has built on more than 20 years of experience with the interrelated fields of education and employment through its Education and Jobs Information Center These resources and the knowledge of community at the neighborhood level will serve the library well as it builds the technical infrastructure required to pursue the library directors vision of the Brooklyn Public Library as a community leader 1 Demographic data from Selected Employment and Commutation

concepts and ethics in an increasingly digital information environment This includes a framework for preservation planning and management from two perspectives 1 contexts for action and 2 priorities for action pointing out similarities and differences between present practice and future needs It suggests that many of the basic tenets of preservation management can be applied in a highly technological environment but that some longheld principles may no longer apply The paper also considers where the accumulated knowledge and experience of preservation management may be most effective in a digital world and where it may be more difficult to affect change In its conceptualization and development this paper has served as a basis for indepth discussions among preservation managers and technical specialists The Commission trusts that with its publication and dissemination the paper will stimulate many more discussions among broader audiences as we explore together how to maintain the safety and accessibility of the worlds historical and cultural heritage as far into the future as possible for all people lth2 alignquotcenterquotgtlta idquotgen1quot namequotgen1quotgtltagtAuthors Prefacelth2gt Digital images are everywhere in libraries and archives In many cases the quality of digital image products from demonstration projects is spectacular while others are less satisfactory Nevertheless there is widespread belief that the ability to produce highquality images will improve as the technology matures Even though a major investment is required for digital image conversion libraries are rearranging budgets raising funds and anticipating income streams to make it happen Can any institutionlibrary archives historical society or museumafford to squander this investment in moving from pilot project to a fully operational system The risk of loss extends beyond the financial however without a serious effort to ensure longterm access to digital image files Understanding how to adapt preservation concepts to manage risk in the midst of rapid technological ferment is what preservation in the digital world is all about In the public at large preservation is a concern chiefly in the world of paper Digital information gives us worryfree preservation it is asserted because an exact copy of a file can be made with the click of a button However those who have been involved in digital imaging projects including university and library administrators technology system specialists product vendors and research scholars have learned quickly that digital imaging technology in and of itself provides no easy answers for preservation Indeed simply defining what preservation means in the digital imaging environment is a challenge This report suggests a framework for applying fundamental preservation concepts derived from the best present practices of paper and film to the world of digital image documents so that the highest level of responsible preservation planning management and action can continue lth2 alignquotcenterquotgtlta idquotgen2quot namequotgen2quotgtltagtIntroductionlth2gt ltpgtIn ltcitegtMotel of the Mysteriesltcitegt 1979 illustrator David Macaulay speculates about how people 2000 years from now might interpret the cultural significance of a lowbudget roadside motel buried intact under junk mail and pollution Beyond being a wry satire on the science of archaeology the book is a clever reminder of the danger of interpreting the past without documentary evidence A Do Not Disturb sign becomes a sacred seal placed upon the handle of the great outer door by the necropolis officials following the closing of the tomb A television represents the essence of religious communicationltpgt ltpgtAnthropologists and historians know that the impulses to record and to keep are a part of human nature Truth is embedded in the symbols and artifacts that we create and then keep by choice or by accident And yet as we approach the end of the twentieth century we find ourselves confronting a dilemma such as the one faced by Howard Carson Macaulays amateur digger a vast void of knowledge filled

world Computers now far outnumber office workers in many parts of the globe We bank by phone enjoy digitally mastered music fax carryout orders and communicate with each other through keyboarded thoughts One of the sure signs that the global village has a digital face is the high investment of money and competitive energy now being directed toward changing the Internet into the National

funny that a petroleumbased product like a magazine can call an online service that has an integrated Web browser irrelevant Nollinger 1995 p 204ltpgt ltpgtIt has long been the responsibility of libraries and archives to assemble organize and protect documentation of human activity The ethic of preservation as coordinated conscious management however is a more recent phenomenon Librarians and archivistslike the clerks and scribes who went before themhave increased the chances that evidence about how we live how we think and what we have accomplished will be preserved Traditional preservation as responsible custody works only when this evidence has a physical form when the value of the evidence exceeds the cost of keeping it and when the roles of evidence creators evidence keepers and evidence users are mutually reinforcingltpgt ltpgtDigital imaging technology is more than another reformatting option Imaging involves transforming the very concept of format rather than creating an accurate picture of a book document photograph or map on a different medium The power of digital enhancement the possibilities for structured indexes and the mathematics of compression and communication together alter the concept of preservation The digital world transforms traditional preservation concepts from protecting the physical integrity of the object to specifying the creation and maintenance of the object whose intellectual integrity is its primary characteristic This transformation along with the new leadership possibilities it creates will force librarians and archivists to transform their services and programs in turn Just as the invention of the vacuum tube created an entirely new form of mass communicationradioinstead of simply making point to point messaging possible without wires digital imaging technologies create an entirely new form of information Yet many of the core tenets of preservation developed in the analog world can be carried forward to the

evidence of writingpictorial signs on sundried clay tabletsoriginated roughly 6000 years ago Tens of thousands of examples of Sumerian and Babylonian writing exist today in the worlds major research centers Archaeologists unearth hundreds more every year From ancient times to the present the entire technology of writing has undergone steady evolution Today we have the capacity to store detailed bitmapped images of hundreds of books on an optical disk the size of a coaster This capacity to record and store gives rise to one of the central dilemmas of recorded history Our capacity to record information has increased exponentially over time while the longevity of the media used to store the information has decreased equivalentlyltpgt ltpgtThe graph below illustrates these changes in broad

Sebera 1990 Magnetic tape may be unreadable just thirty years after manufacture Van Bogart 1995 p 11 The newest recording mediumoptical diskmay indeed have a longer life than the digital recording surfaces that have gone before It is likely however that todays optical storage media may long outlast the life of the computer system that created the information in the first place This is the ultimate irony of recorded history In order to achieve the kind of information density that is common today we must depend on machines that rapidly reach obsolescence to create information and then make it readable and intelligible Dollar 1992ltpgt ltpgtThe mix of machinery and media of the digital world increases the need for responsible preservation activity in institutions To help discover how to meet this increased need this report first presents a framework of primary preservation concepts as they have evolved in past decades It then redefines and transforms these concepts into a new framework for action in the digital worldltpgt lth2 alignquotcenterquotgtlta idquotgen4quot namequotgen4quotgtltagtA Framework of Preservation Conceptslth2gt ltpgtIn the past two decades a community of practitioners has reached consensus on a set of fundamental preservation concepts for managing available resources in a mature preservation program Conway 1989 At one time advocates for the protection of cultural artifacts including books primary source documents and museum objects used the terms conservation and preservation interchangeably Today preservation is an umbrella term for the many policies and options for action including conservation treatments Preservation is the acquisition organization and distribution of resources to prevent further deterioration or renew the usability of selected groups of materialsltpgt ltpgtThe essence of preservation management is resource allocation People money and materials must be acquired organized and put to work to ensure that information sources are given adequate protection Preservation is concerned with evidencewhat Michael Buckland 1991 calls information as thingembedded in the intellectual content of objects and in the objects themselves Nearly endless varieties of forms and formats are preserved so that people can use them for equally varied purposes scholarly and otherwise Those with the responsibility to do so find the small portions of the vast sea of informationstructured as collections of documents books photographs and films sound recordings and other thingsthat have research value as evidence of thought and action well beyond the time and intentions of those who created or published themltpgt ltpgtCosteffective preservation action cannot take place without compromising ideal outcomes Preservation management encompasses all the policies procedures and processes that together prevent further deterioration of physical objects renew the information they contain and increase their functional value This distinction between the value of the content usually text and illustration and the value of the artifact is at the heart of a decisionmaking process that itself is central to effective management Preservation management includes an ongoing iterative process of planning and implementing prevention activities eg maintaining a stable safe and secure environment ensuring disaster preparedness and building a basic collectionlevel maintenance program and renewal activities eg undertaking conservation treatments replacing the content of library materials or reformatting them on microfilmltpgt ltpgtIn the world of paper and film preservation and access are separate but related activities It is possible to fulfill a preservation need of a manuscript collection for example without solving the collections access problems Similarly access to scholarly materials can be guaranteed for a very long period of time with taking concrete preservation action Modern preservation management strategies however posit that preservation action is taken on an item so that it may be used In this view creating a preservation copy of a deteriorated book on microfilm without making it possible to find the film usually by cataloging it and then depositing the bibliographic record in a national database is a waste of money Preservation in the digital world puts to rest any lingering notion that preservation and access are separable activitiesltpgt ltpgtSignificant financial barriers slow the design and implementation of effective preservation strategies Some leaders in the field have suggested however that inadequate funding may not be the only brake on preservation success The major obstacle to the development and administration of preservation programs is the shortage not of money as many suppose but of knowledge wrote Pamela Darling 1981 p 185 Financial constraints are serious and will become more so but until the preservation field reaches the point at which most people know what ought to be done and how it should be done the lack of money to do it on a scale appropriate to the need is not terribly significant The basic consciousnessraising

of modern research libraries and archives Preservation wrote Pelham Barr in his most frequently cited work as responsible custody is the only library function which should be continuously at work twentyfour hours a day It is the only function which should be concerned with every piece of material in the library from the moment the selector becomes aware of its existence to the day it is discarded 1946 pp 21819 Barrs allusion to the lifecycle of information sources is highly relevant today The concept is at the center of information management theory and practice including specifications for the disposition of government archives the management of book collections and the maintenance of largescale information technology systems Atherton 1986ltpgt ltpgtltigtSocial valueltigt Organizations that accept preservation as central to their mission also serve a larger societal need The fundamental value of keeping intact the documentation of people and institutions has endured through years of changing practice Almost sixty years ago Robert C Binkley a pioneer of preservation microfilming pinpointed the cultural value of preservation The objective of archival policy in a democratic country cannot be the mere saving of paper he said to one of the first gatherings of professional archivists It must be nothing less than the enriching of the complete historical consciousness of the people as a whole 1939ltbrgt p 168 More recently educator Guy Petherbridge echoed the same sentiments The perpetuation of society as we are accustomed to conceive or idealize it

preservation actionfueled perhaps by the persuasive message in the film Slow Fireshas resulted in national and regional planning efforts and new dollars for preservation programs Even the word archives carrying the mandate to preserve and protect the secrets they contain has entered the popular vocabulary Cox 1993 Part of the service that libraries and archives provide to society is or will be their investment in converting storing and making available research resources in digital image form Protecting this investment through prudent preservation action will continue to be the social role of hundreds of organizations that participate in digital library initiativesltpgt ltpgtltigtStructureltigt An organizational structure that enables preservation resource allocation is imperative The mission of an institution and the relevance of that mission to a larger social purpose are necessary though insufficient on their own to mobilize preservation action Robert Patterson suggested a mechanism for a librarywide preservation development process that was equal parts consciousness raising and strategic planning His argument on the administrative difficulties of building an effective new program rings true today when it is read with the recognized challenges of digital image technologies in mind Historically many librarians have felt that a conservation program was too technically complex a matter for them to undertake Armed with some basic principles and facts a program with realistic goals can be developed 1979 p 1116 The overwhelming trend in the development of mature preservation programs has been the coalescing of responsibility in a single department which then sets about making itself in the best Weberian tradition essential to the organizationltpgt ltpgtltigtCooperationltigt Resource sharing and cooperation among institutions to select and preserve the best and most valuable cultural artifacts are core preservation values The ups and downs of cooperative activities are well documented as are the challenges of maintaining momentum when taking any action that does not immediately benefit the local institution Gwinn 1985 The largest and most prestigious research librariesspurred by the ready availability of external fundingmay have led preservation program development in the last two decades but advocates for peertopeer or regional cooperation have sounded a warning about the dangers of elitism Vartan Gregorian reminded a large audience of preservation activists that all of us are in the same boat When the boat sinks no one can claim the fact that they had a first class ticket as solace Morrow 1991 p 85ltpgt ltpgtThe need to organize for local action often creates a direct tension with national cooperative initiatives Rutherford Rogers Yale Universitys librarian during the heyday of preservation program growth called for an emphasis on local goals informed but not controlled by national priorities National planning he declared cannot supplant local programs or relieve us of our responsibility to develop them Instead we must take advantage of the large support network of collective research and educational activities to develop local programs suited to local needs a network that may serve as the basis of a true national program 1985 p 8 When properly managed interinstitutional cooperative preservation

namequotgen6quotgtltagtPriorities for Actionlth3gt ltpgtFive concepts together can be seen to help direct the priorities for preservation actionltpgt ltpgtltigtLongevityltigt The central concern in traditional preservation practice has been the media upon which information is stored The term archival used to mean permanent and preservation focused on infinity Jim OToole reviews the transformation of the definition of longevity The idea of permanence as it is understood by archivists has changed considerably over time passing from an unattainable desire to an absolute value within the realm of achievement to an extremely relative notion of little clarity 1989 p 23 Today archivists and librarians evaluate storage media in terms of their life expectancies The top priority is extending the useability of papers films magnetic tapes and other media by stabilizing their structures and limiting the ability of internal and external factors to cause deterioration The focus on external factors led to specifications for proper environmental controls care and handling guidelines and disaster recovery procedures Progress on efforts to control the internal factors of deterioration has resulted in alkaline paper standards archival quality microfilm and more rugged magnetic media Calmes 1987ltpgt ltpgtltigtChoiceltigt Preservation adds value through selection Choice involves defining value recognizing it in something and then deciding to address preservation needs in the way most appropriate to that value Selection in archives and research libraries was once thought to be primarily a onetime decision about the potential for future use made near the time of publication or when the documents ceased to serve the primary purposes for which they had been created originally Atkinson 1986 p 345 Over decades the act of preservation has evolved from saving material from oblivion and assembling it in secure buildings to encompass more sophisticated condition value and use assessments on the alreadycollected Preservation selection in libraries has been dictated largely by the need to stretch limited resources in as wise a fashion as possible resulting in the dictum that no item shall be reformatted twice The end result is a growing virtual special collection of items preserved using a variety of techniques most notably by microfilming Selection is perhaps the most difficult of undertakings precisely because it is static and conceived by practitioners as either completely divorced from present use or completely driven by demand Demas 1994ltpgt ltpgtltigtQualityltigt Maximizing the quality of all work performed is such an important maxim in the preservation field that few people state this fundamental principle directly Instead the preservation literature dictates high quality outcomes by specifying standards for treatment options reformatting processes and preventive measures The commitment to quality standardsdo it once do it rightpermeates all preservation activity including library binding standards archival microfilming guidelines conservation treatment procedures the choice of supplies and materials and a low tolerance for error The evolution of microfilming as a central strategy for preserving brittle library materials has placed the quality of the medium and the quality of the image on an equal plane Fox 1996 In the pursuit of quality microfilm compromise on visual truth and archival stability is dictated more by the characteristics of the item chosen for preservation and less by cost or the present state of display technologiesltpgt ltimg classquotimg floatstartquot titlequotfig4gifquot srcquot aposassetsimagesreportspub62fig457d70f7fdec96gifapos relativeurl quot altquotfig4gifquot widthquot240quot heightquot276quotgt ltpgtltigtIntegrityltigt The concept of integrity has two dimensions in the preservation context physical and intellectual Physical integrity largely concerns the item as artifact and plays out most directly in the conservation studio where skilled bench staff use watersoluble glues ageold handbinding techniques and highquality materials to protect historical evidence of use past conservation treatments and intended or unintended changes to the structure of the item Tanselle 1989 The ethics of conservation recognize that all physical treatments change the nature of the object and therefore are not really reversible by nature Dureau 1986ltpgt ltpgtThe preservation of intellectual integrity is based upon concern for evidence of a different sort The authenticity or truthfulness of the information content of an itemmaintained through careful and complete reformatting or sensitive treatmentis at the heart of intellectual integrity Duranti 1995 Ideally documentation supports the preservation of intellectual and physical integrity by creating a chain of evidence connecting multiple formats of the object and recording what has been or needs to be done to any one of these formats in the name of preservation Preservation also protects and documents the relationships among items in a collection The concepts of quality and integrity reinforce each otherltpgt ltpgtltigtAccessltigt For years preservation simply meant collecting The sheer act of pulling a collection of manuscripts from a barn a basement or a parking garage and placing it intact in a dry building with locks on the door fulfilled the fundamental preservation mandate of the institution In this regard preservation and access have been mutually exclusive activities often in constant tension While preservation is a primary goal or responsibility an equally compelling mandateaccess and usesets up a classic conflict that must be arbitrated by the custodians and caretakers of archival records states a fundamental textbook in the field Ritzenthaler 1993 p 1 Access mechanisms such as bibliographic records and archival finding aids simply provide a notice of availability and are not an integral part of the objectltpgt ltpgtAfter years of disciplined practice most librarians archivists conservators and scientists recognize these nine concepts of preservation action The same learning curve that has led to the acceptance of current preservation practice must now take place for digital imaging technology in a timeframe of years instead of decadesltpgt lth2 alignquotcenterquotgtlta idquotgen7quot namequotgen7quotgtltagtTechnology and Organizational Changelth2gt ltpgtTechnologies and organizations affect each other in different ways depending in large part upon the characteristics of technologies and how organizations choose to use them In this regard it is important first to distinguish between acquiring digital imaging technology to solve a particular problem and adopting it as an information management strategy Acquiring an imaging system to experiment with its capability to enhance access to library and archive materials is now almost as simple as purchasing tools in a hardware store Simply buying a technology solution has no longterm implications for an organization However when pilot imaging projects are transformed and adopted as core systems for creating and delivering electronic documents with longterm value preservation in the digital world becomes an important organizational issueltpgt ltimg

technology as it has quickly proliferated in libraries and archives has been largely a means for achieving ends already decided upon Microfilm was and remains wellsuited for reproducing bulky and fragile newspapers and for distributing research materials largely unknown or unusable in their native locations Continuous wave radio on the other hand created a world of new possibilities for which new corporate goals had to be formulated In that sense it acquired a determinative force to which organizational decisionmaking had to adapt writes Hugh Aitken Unlike microphotography radio broadcasting encountered a cultural phenomenon that it has not itself created a mass market for information and entertainment the existence of which had been barely suspected Aitken 1985 p 562ltpgt ltpgtThe early years of microphotography are marked by visionary descriptions of revolutionary possibilities for mass distribution of books on small glass plates rather than on paper Luther 1959 Susan Cady 1990 suggests that any vision that sees new technologies replacing old ones ignores the centuriesold reality that new communication technology merely expands opportunities adds diversity and creates a more complex environment For every new technology that today functions beside an old one ltigtegltigt television and radio it is possible to identify a new technology that actually was

years ago In the digital world preservation becomes possible because preservationas it is defined in this paperis an intimate part of the new possibilities In the digital world preservation must be concerned with entire technology systems not one or another component such as a film or a storage disk Like radio television and electric power networks digital imaging is not one technology It is an interlinked open system of hardware software and service subsystems each with their own components that develops in cycles Digital systems are characterized by multiple core subsystems scanners and

characteristics alone At critical junctures he suggests organizational action and inaction dramatically affects the shape and direction of technological change 1992 p 312ltpgt ltpgtLibraries and

the Digital Worldlth2gt ltpgtAs librarians and archivists have experimented with the capabilities of digital imaging technologies the concept of preservation has come to have at least three distinct meaningsltpgt ltpgtltigtMake Use Possibleltigt For a very small subset of valuable but deteriorated documents digital imaging technology is a viable and possibly the only costeffective mechanism for facilitating research use A recent experiment involving digitizing oversize color maps Gertz 1995 demonstrated that the only way to really use the maps which have faded badly and are very brittle is to view them on a large color monitor after they have been digitized and enhanced Similarly the managers of the Andrew Wyeth estate have found that reproductions of the artists work are most faithfully represented in digital form Mintzer and McFall 1991ltpgt ltpgtltigtProtect Original Itemsltigt Digital image technology can be used to create a high quality copy of an original item By limiting direct physical access to valuable documents digital imaging becomes a preservation application as distinct from an access application The original order of the collection or book is frozen much like microfilm sets images in a linear sequence Sophisticated indexing schemes facilitate browsing and minimize the potential for damage or disruption to a collection caused by fishing expeditions through the published or unpublished record Preservation via digital copying has been the most compelling force motivating archives and libraries to experiment with hardware and software capabilitiesltpgt ltimg classquotimg floatstartquot titlequotfig6gifquot srcquot aposassetsimagesreportspub62fig657d70f7fdefc1gifapos relativeurl quot altquotfig6gifquot widthquot217quot heightquot274quotgt ltpgtltigtMaintain Digital Objectsltigt Once digital conversion of the original document has been completed the challenge of protecting the digits from corruption or destruction becomes the preservation focus This facet now being called digital preservation typically centers on the choice of interim storage media the life expectancy of a digital imaging system and the concern for migrating the digital files to future systems as a way of ensuring future access ltcitegtPreserving Digital Informationltcitegt 1995ltpgt ltpgtA workable framework for preservation in the digital world could encompass the initial choice of the technology the use of digital imaging technology for reproducing research materials and the protection of the digital information for as long as that information has value to the institution and the patrons the institution serves The process of converting library materials to an electronic forma process which in many aspects is similar to the one used to create preservation microfilmis distinct from any particular medium upon which the images may be stored at a particular point in time This distinction allows for a continuing commitment to creating and maintaining digitized information while entertaining the possibility that other more advanced systems may render digital storage media obsolete Preservation management of digital image files encompasses their creation organization and indexing storage transmission and continued intellectual integrityltpgt ltpgtThe following section proposes how the nine fundamental concepts of preservation described above can be transformed in response to the particular characteristics of digital informationltpgt lth3 alignquotcenterquotgtlta idquotgen9quot namequotgen9quotgtltagtContext For Actionlth3gt ltpgtltigtCustodyltigt In the digital world a library archives or museum cannot make a decision to adopt imaging technologies for longterm conversion and storage of research collections in digital form without a deep and continuing commitment to preservation by the parent institution The preservation mission that was once largely the prerogative of the library must become the preservation mandate of the parent institution The necessary financial and technological commitments to maintain image system life and migrate image system data to future generations must permeate the highest levels of the organizationltpgt ltpgtltigtSocial Valueltigt The particular value to society of preservation in the digital world has less to do with historical consciousness and group memoryas advocates for traditional preservation have claimedand much more to do with service to academic scholarly and public communities Active use is the lifeline of the loosely connected clusters of unique in digital form highly valuable and intensely consulted digital collections that form a digital library worth preservingltpgt ltimg classquotimg floatstartquot titlequotfig7gifquot srcquot aposassetsimagesreportspub62fig757d70f7fdf123gifapos relativeurl quot altquotfig7gifquot widthquot240quot heightquot224quotgt ltpgtltigtStructureltigt Organizing for preservation in the digital world is not first and foremost a search for process efficiency as has been the case with traditional preservation but rather an ongoing process of risk management where the cost of digital file migration is judged against the cost of failure to preserve the files in terms of the patrons who need the information The stakeholders in this organization extend well beyond the bounds of a preservation department or the administration of a library or archives to encompass technology specialists marketing experts and commercial vendorsltpgt ltpgtltigtCooperationltigt As preservation in the digital world becomes less a centrally managed enterprise at the institutional level and more a mutually reinforcing shared responsibility cooperation and institutional selfinterest should reinforce each other When approaching the challenges of preservation institutions will contribute to the required cost and the technical expertise because there will simply be no other way to satisfy their patrons

ltpgtltigtLongevityltigt Preservation in the digital world has little concern for the longevity of optical disks magnetic tape and other new fragile storage media The viability of digital image files is much more dependent on the life expectancy of the access systema chain only as strong as its weakest component Digital storage media must be handled with care but they most likely will far outlast the capability of systems to retrieve and interpret the data stored on them Since we can never know for certain when a system has become obsolete libraries must be prepared to migrate valuable image data indexes and software to future generations of the technology Migration is now and will remain a very challenging task as the recent digital archiving task force has pointed out ltcitegtPreserving Digital Informationltcitegt 1995ltpgt ltpgtltigtChoiceltigt Selection for preservation in digital form is not a onetime choice made near the end of an items life cycle but rather an ongoing process intimately connected to the active use of the digital files The value judgments applied when making a decision to convert documents from paper or film to digital image are valid only within the context of the original system With the need to migrate data to another storage and access system comes the mandate to revisit again and again the decision to continue preserving the information It is a rare collection of digital files indeed that can justify the cost of a comprehensive migration strategy without factoring in the larger intellectual context of related digital files stored elsewhere and their combined uses for research and scholarship Conway 1996ltpgt ltpgtlta namequotgen10quotgtltagtltpgt ltpgtltigtQualityltigt Quality in the digital worldthat is the usefulness and useability of systemsis conditioned significantly by the limitations of capture and display technology Digital conversion places less emphasis on obtaining a faithful reproduction of the original in favor of finding the best representation of the original in digital form Mechanisms and techniques for judging quality of digital reproductions are different and more sophisticated than those for assessing microfilm or photocopy reproductions Kenney and Chapman 1995 Additionally the primary goal of preservation quality is to capture as much intellectual and visual content as is technically possible and then display that content to viewers in ways most appropriate to their needsltpgt ltpgtlta namequotgen10quotgtltagtltpgt ltpgtltigtIntegrityltigt In the digital world both physical and intellectual integrity have their place in preservation A commitment to the physical integrity of a digital image file has far less to do with the media upon which the data are stored than with the loss of information that occurs when a file is created originally and then compressed mathematically for storage or transmission across a network In the domain of intellectual integrity index information is not independent of the content of the item but rather is an integral part of the digital file Structural indexes and data descriptions traditionally published with an item as tables of contents or prepared as discrete finding aids or bibliographic records must be preservedas metadataalong with the digital image files themselves Weibel 1995 The preservation of intellectual integrity also involves authentication procedures like audit trails to make sure files are not altered intentionally or accidentally Lynch 1994ltpgt ltpgtlta namequotgen10quotgtltagtltpgt ltpgtltigtAccessltigt In the digital world the concept of access is transformed from a convenient byproduct of the preservation process to its central motif The content structure and integrity of the information object assume center stage the ability of a machine to transport and display this information object becomes an assumed end result of preservation action rather than its primary goal Preservation in the digital world is not simply the act of preserving access but also includes a description of the thing to be preserved In the context of this report the object of preservation is a highquality highvalue wellprotected and fully integrated version of an original source documentltpgt ltpgtlta namequotgen10quotgtltagtltpgt ltpgtAdministrators who have responsibility for selecting systems for converting materials with longterm value also bear responsibility for providing longterm access to the digital versions This responsibility is a continuing one Decisions about longterm storage and access cannot be deferred in the hope that technological solutions will emerge An appraisal of the present value of a book a manuscript collection or a series of photographs in its original format is the necessary point of departure for making a judgment about preservation of the digital image version The mere potential for increased access to a digitized collection does not add value to an underutilized collection Similarly the powerful capabilities of a relational index cannot compensate for a collection of documents whose structure relationships and intellectual content is poorly understoodltpgt ltpgtIf libraries archives and museums expect to adopt digital imaging technology for purposes of transforming the way they serve their patrons and each other then they must move beyond the experimental stage Digital image conversion in an operational environment requires a deep and longstanding institutional commitment to preservation the full integration of the technology into

over digital imaging technology most probably will find that moral persuasion cannot often prevail in the absence of a significant market share Others have argued that the rapid pace of technological change and the sheer complexity of information technologies render librarians and archivists helpless in influencing product developments Yet those who prefer to wait and see how digital imaging technology shakes out before making the administrative commitments necessary to ensure longterm preservation are shirking their responsibility to help define the terms of the debateltpgt ltpgt ltimg dataattachmentidquot13230quot srcquot aposassetsimagesreportspub62fig9gifapos relativeurl quot altquotfig 9quot widthquot240quot heightquot272quotgt ltpgt ltpgtEach of these perspectives ignores an imperative of leadership A leader is one who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by leader and followers writes Garry Wills 1994 p 70 Preservation in the digital world must encompass shared goals that leaders and followers elicit together It is the responsibility of many people in many institutions fulfilling many roles of both leader and follower Accepting the differentiation of roles is crucial if librarians and archivists are to identify which of the many facets of digital technology they can control where their expertise is one of many important influences and when they must accept the processes and products of the socioeconomic system of which libraries and archives are but one partltpgt ltpgtThe following table summarizes key aspects of digital imaging technology that are important for creating and maintaining access to digital image files over a long period of time It arrays these aspects on two dimensions the priorities for action and the degree of power that librarians and archivists can have over accomplishing the goals implied by the prioritiesltpgt ltpgtltigtLongevityltigt Librarians can exercise a large measure of control over the lifeexpectancy of digital image data through the careful selection handling and maintenance of rugged welltested recording and storage systems They can influence the life expectancy of the information by making sure that local budgetary commitments are made consistently and at an appropriate level in support of longterm migration strategies Ultimately the library community may have little control over the evolution of the imaging marketplace especially corporate research and development activities that have a tremendous impact on the life expectancy of the digital files being creating todayltpgt ltpgtltigtChoiceltigt Even while recognizing that selection decisions cannot be made autonomously or in a vacuum librarians and archivists can choose which books articles photographs films and other materials are converted from paper or film into digital image form Influence over the continuing value of digital image files is largely vested in the right to decide when it is time to migrate image data to a future storage and access system and in knowing when a digital file has outlived its usefulness to the institution charged with preserving it Librarians and archivists while not directly responsible for the capabilities of their patrons can nonetheless help determine how digital information will be provided and help educate users about use of new technologies to meet their needsltpgt ltpgtltigtQualityltigt The commercial imaging market has transformed the principle of maintaining the highest possible quality over time to one of finding the minimal level of quality acceptable to todays system users Quality of the digital object including the richness of both the image and the associated indexes is the heart and soul of preservation in the digital world This means maximizing the amount of data captured in the digital scanning process documenting image enhancement techniques and specifying file compression routines that do not result in the loss of data during telecommunication Librarians and archivists can control standards of digital image quality just as they have done for microfilm They can only influence the development of standards for data compression communication and derivatives for display and output Research laboratories and the imaging marketplace will have the greatest influence over improvements in the technical capabilities of digital conversion and storage systemsltpgt ltpgt ltimg classquotsizefull wpimage13231 img floatstartquot srcquot aposassetsimagesreportspub62fig10gifapos relativeurl quot altquotfig 10quot widthquot240quot heightquot275quotgt ltpgt ltpgtltigtIntegrityltigt Librarians and archivists can help exercise control over the integrity of digital image files by authenticating access procedures and documenting successive modifications to a given digital file They can also create and maintain structural indexes and bibliographic linkages within welldeveloped and wellunderstood database standards Librarians and archivists are acknowledged experts in organizing information and so have a vital role to play in influencing the development of metadata interchange standards including the tools and techniques that will allow structured documented and standardized information about data files and databases to be shared across platforms systems and international boundaries However librarians and archivists may find they are but bystanders in the rapid development of network protocols bandwidth or data security techniquesltpgt ltpgtltigtAccessltigt The digital imaging marketplace is highly competitive Librarians and archivists can do the most to ensure continuing access to digital image files through prudent purchases of nonproprietary hardware and software components In the present environment true plug and play components are becoming more widely available purchase decisions are the most powerful incentives for vendors to adopt open system architectures or at least provide better documentation on the inner workings of their systems Additionally librarians and archivists can influence vendors and manufacturers to develop new systems that are backwardly compatible with existing ones This capability assists image file system migration in the same way that todays word processing software allows access to documents created with earlier versions The life expectancy of a given digital image system and the requirement to migrate valuable digital image files to future generations of the technology are profoundly important matters over which librarians and archivists have little or no control It seems that the commitment of a vendor to support and maintain an old system is inversely related to that vendors ability to market a new systemltpgt lth2 alignquotcenterquotgtlta idquotgen12quot namequotgen12quotgtltagtConclusionlth2gt ltpgtPreservation in the digital world challenges librarians and archivists but not necessarily due to a lack of understanding of digital technologies selection criteria or appropriate preservation options The technologies are becoming understood well enough Informed choices about what to preserve in the digital world and the best ways to accomplish preservation goals both derive from this understandingltpgt ltpgtThe real challenge is creating appropriate organizational contexts for action Cooperative strategies adopted from ongoing preservation practice are not all that is needed to address the complexities or the costs of digital technologies Libraries and archives must do more than simply divide the preservation pie The national digital libraries that are now under construction should be built under an umbrella of guiding preservation concepts Additionally new approaches to creating and maintaining digital files cooperatively must be developed The acceptance of shared responsibility and shared funding commitments will preserve access to what are in essence unique electronic collectionsltpgt ltpgtWill the totality of the national digital librarywhether it is a single entity or many things to many peoplebe of such high quality and of such extraordinary value to a university a state government or other institution that each participant will make a longterm commitment to help support its preservation Only if the answer to this question is yes will it be possible to build that library cooperatively Establishing such commitments requires the kind of leadership that has set the context for traditional preservation action in the past two decadesltpgt

By Patricia A McClung February 1996 Foreword This report the first to be commissioned jointly by the Commission on Preservation and Access and Council on Library Resources informs and supports our digital library programs Digital technology is central to both agendas and the new affiliation between the Commission and Council enables such collaboration to investigate areas of common interest Each time librarians or scholars or technology experts meetseparately or together to discuss digital projects someone invariably raises the question Are there any sorts of inventories of scanning projects There areit seems several incomplete lists or promises to start such lists but no one could point to one authoritative source We concluded that a snapshot of scanning projects at a particular point in time might serve as a beginning for a more comprehensive authoritative inventory to be maintained indefinitely into the future To that end we engaged a reliable and careful researcher to do as much as possible to collect information within a short timeframe and to provide a brief analysis of some of the questions and needs related to the development of an inventory tool In discussions sparked by this report we hope to determine ways to build on this snapshot to create an inventory that librarians archivists and scholars will turn to with confidence when seeking information about digital collections This report is shared as a way of stimulating discussion and soliciting further input on the potential usefulness scope and desired features of an online digital collections inventory The Commission and Council welcome commends in either paper or digital form to Communication Program Officer Maxine Sitts mksittscpaorg fax 202 9393499 Deanna B Marcum President Preface The digital age creates new delivery and access alternatives for libraries as well as new preservation challenges In turn the expectations of library users are changing As people discover information resources online at their computer workstations they also want access to the contents of libraries in that same online environment Digital conversion projects help provide the content for an online digital library in some cases projects conducted according to sound preservation guidelines also serve to reformat deteriorating paperbased resources The Council on Library Resources and the Commission on Preservation and Access undertook this project to learn more about the types of digital conversion efforts underway or completed in libraries and archives The idea was to take a first cut at sketching the nature and extent of efforts to make traditional retrospective collections available in digital form rather than to produce a comprehensive inventory While there is much talk of virtual libraries it is not easy to discern how much progress is really being made from exploratory projects to new modes of access Furthermore creating online collections involves more than conversion of resources from paper or film to digital format For example it is helpful to know what subjects and media have been converted in order to focus on complementary materials or fill in major gaps in the digital canon Quality issues that affect the preservation of and longterm access to digitized resources as well as efficacy of their use also can be best addressed when institutions share information and project results This preliminary investigation and its appendices exemplify the paradoxical nature of the transition to a digital world The findings argue strongly that the online tools now at our disposalparticularly the World Wide Web can do a much better job than this printed report of providing information and multidimensional access to these kinds of resources This report is intended to move us closer to that goal Patricia A McClung Introduction by Patricia McClung Digital Collaboration Associates August 1995 Updated December 1995 Context The explosion in popularity of the Internet underscores the tremendous potential that now exists for rapid networked sharing of information across the country and around the world While tools such as World Wide Web and Netscape make the Internet readily accessible even to novice computer users a major impediment to such a global network of linked information resources is the fact that most documents are not yet available in electronic form Cultural institutions and universitiesas major collectors organizers preservers and disseminators of informationrepresent one of the best sources of content for this emerging global information network Increasingly they are committing resources to making information contained in their collections as widely available as possible capitalizing on the evolving electronic information infrastructure To do this they will undertake massive projects to convert portions of their retrospective collections which exist in a variety of formats There has recently been a burst of activity much of it experimental in nature towards this end However several very large electronic conversion projects and related initiatives intended to test and shape the new information infrastructure are also getting underway All of them presuppose an information system that has either the Internet or a more robust successor at its core If successful they will go a long way towards real implementation of the digital revolution that has been predicted for so long CPACLR Inventory In July 1995 the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Council on Library Resources undertook a joint project to determine how much digitizing of library collections was planned underway or completed The object of the survey was to show which collectionssubjects were available for on line use as well as to highlight where there was little or no conversion activity In addition the project was intended to gather sufficient data to ascertain whether an on line index or guide to digital conversion projects would be either useful or practical Because the time frame for the study was quite limited it was impossible to be comprehensive But time was not the only restriction Given the rate at which projects are announced launched and sometimes tabled a complete study would be seriously out of date before it left the desktop printer In fact a significant percentage of the projects cited in previous studies have yet to materialize1fn1 Similarly some that were successfully launched and held great promise like the JANUS project at the Columbia University Law Libraries were unsuccessful due to technical or financial problems In addition many of the digital collections that do exist are not widely available via the Internet either because of local technical limitations or copyright issues As for the surveys methodology it evolved as the exercise took shape along the way It started with a brief questionnaire which was circulated via several listservs as well as to a number of individuals who were known to be involved in various digital conversion activities The questions were brief and to the point Which of your library or archive collections have been scanned or digitized Did the project include the entire collection or simply a portion of it If a portion how much Under what subject would you classify each of the scanned collections or perhaps more appropriately can you categorize each of the scanned collections by subject The questionnaire yielded approximately 40 responses The questionnaire was a useful instrument but as it turned out the most productive data gathering resulted from following leads from one knowledgeable person to another interspersed with World Wide Web expeditions on the Internet As is frequently the case with most investigations in and of cyberspace serendipity played a major role The Data As expected the investigations turned up a hodgepodge of responses There are innumerable projects which feature pictorial images eg photograph collections maps drawings of some sort or museum collections there are documentary text editing projects for individual personal papers there are literary and historical text encoding projects which for the most part feature SGML encoding there are efforts to convert entire collections or to provide a critical mass of materials in a particular subject area and there are a wide variety of experimental projects of one flavor or another In addition to projects which convert printbased andor photographic materials there are a host of mixedmedia projects as well as projects focused on additional formats such as sound recordings films microfilm motion picture film etc There are also a number of initiatives to make materials whose original format is electronic widely available via the Internet Many of these projects are clearly experimental in nature experimentation is essential in these early stages of the development of an electronic information environment A number of other projects seem to be undertaken because of a widespread feeling that it is important to have digital projects underway in order to be current with the trends but even these help to increase the knowledge base in the library and academic communitysomething which is also extremely important to the transition Taken altogether the inventory highlights clusters of initiatives and indicates that a critical mass of on line resources is evolvingalthough not yet with any apparent coherence or logic In the course of the survey it was pointed out more than once that a clearer definition of what was meant by scanned collections was needed to help the potential respondents understand what the inventory would and would not include While the focus of the investigation was to compile an inventory of retrospective library and archive collections that have been or will soon be converted to electronic form for networked distribution the actual situation in cyberspace is that there are no clear demarcations or obvious definitions for distinguishing types of electronic resources and tools In fact there are many different perceptions and working definitions of what actually constitutes a scanning a digitization andor an electronic conversion project If the survey is an accurate indicator most people use these terms somewhat interchangeably to refer to a variety of initiatives that ultimately result in electronic availability of retrospective materials converted from other formats The reason is that although the term scanning usually refers to the capture of digital page images also referred to as bitmapped or raster images this form of digital capture is sometimes followed by optical character recognition OCR conversion to fully searchable textwhich then might be encoded using SGML HTML or some other markup language In fact there are very few scanningonly projects other than for pictorial types of images Furthermore it is obvious from this survey that no two projects are exactly alike Technical decisions are governed by many factors the available hardware software and expertise the nature and formats of the materials themselves the anticipated use and the budget That said the conversion projects usually fall into one of these general technical categories Digital image projects that take an electronic photograph of pages graphics prints photographic materials maps or whatever with accompanying metadata for describing structuring and indexing the image database2fn2 Digital imaging projects with additional textsearchable files generated from the images these can be uncorrected text files used for indexing purposes Fulltext conversion projects involving either keyboard entry or Optical Scanning Recognition OCR3fn3 Text encoding projects using SGML or HTML or some other mark up language4fn4 This survey report focuses primarily on the first two categories both of which involve the electronic photograph capture methodoften referred to as scanning This method is used most often in the retrospective conversion of traditional source material because it can accurately render the information layout and presentation of original source documents The third and fourth categories produce electronic textthat is data that can be manipulated for searching and indexing purposes5fn5 While there is still considerable discussion in the field about which of these four options is appropriateand when the users of these electronic documents are beginning to speak up They want to download and manipulate the text and imagesnot just look at a book page on a computer screen Some projects are providing both a digital image and an electronic version of textual materials However the economic factors rear their ugly heads at this point because fully searchable texts are far more expensive and time consuming to produce than bitmapped page image scans6fn6 Finding out about Digitized Collections In the course of this survey its author encountered some very interesting Internet navigation aids and resources that relate to the second reason for this inventory to assess the usefulness andor practicality of developing some type of tool or database that includes information on the wide assortment of electronic conversion initiatives Clearly there is not yet a straightforward logical mechanism for finding out what collections are available in electronic form and where and how7fn7 Further there is very little ability to filter or assess the resources that are thereand they range from the ridiculous to the sublime However there are some promising models as well as some effective Weblinked resources that could inform a decision about the usefulness or the essential characteristics of a database of scanning projects Further study of these tools may be warranted Following the inventory list of digital conversion projects this report includes brief descriptions of some promising infrastructure projects Although they are not conversion projects per se they are very closely related in that they address some of the practical technical legal economic and philosophical problems that currently impede efficient storing retrieving transmitting and true sharing of the types of electronic resources the inventory describes The report concludes with a list of lists which refers to other valuable sources of information that supplement the citations in this report Conclusions This inventory is a workinprogress In its present iteration it represents a cross section of the types of digital conversion projects planned underway or completed Due to time limitations it does not include journal projects or online exhibitions For the most part textencoding initiatives videodisk projects CD ROM publications and documentary editing projects were considered out of scope Except for documentary editing projects these sources are well indexed in other on line tools some of which are mentioned in the final section of this report entitled List of Lists8fn8 The results of the survey were difficult to organize in a logical framework for a printed publication Although some group naturally together most are distinct enough to defy easy categorization The sheer number of projects the wide variety in focus subject matter and formats as well as the fact that the pertinent information is changing constantly all argue for a managed online finding tool of some sort In the future if this inventory expands and evolves into an on line tool it should include features that were beyond the scope of this projectespecially information about access to and availability of the materials as well as any copyright restrictions Ideally the tool should link directly to the referenced project Web page or the materials themselves as well as to other subject or format based tools which index or link to related materials Input from other experts on a useful structure and content definition as well as more verified meat on the inventorys bones are needed if it is to become a useful information sourceeither a database or a Web site It is clear from this survey that momentum is building and that in certain subject areas a critical mass of on line resources is beginning to accumulate At the international level there are promising indications of large scale projects in Europe and elsewhere that will make other national literature and political documents much more accessible At home the Library of Congresss National Digital Library Projectin combination with the goals of the complementary National Digital Library Federationhold great promise as well Undoubtedly it is time for such major initiatives to build on the smaller grass roots experimentation that has already occurred Taken together these initiatives have the potential to dramatically increase and improve access to information and perhaps even preserve it over time Preliminary Results of the CPACLR Digital Collections Inventory conducted by Patricia A McClung August 1995 Updated December 1995 For discussion purposes and in an attempt to find coherence in what is still a very chaotic and fluid information environment the survey results are grouped as follows gt I Very large projects featuring national literature history andor politics gt II Examples of broad subject areas with significant activity gt eg law literature history and culture and science and technology gt III Examples of special archival and manuscript collections gt IV Infrastructure projects and List of Lists Admittedly these categories are arbitrary Several other groupings could have been made and in fact were before settling on these The important thing was to find a logical framework arbitrary or not to give a sense of the types and scale of activities that are increasingly available to scholars at all levels and in all fields In general the focus is on the conversion of library collections Occasionally commercial projects are mentioned when their content features existing library collections CDROM publications and videodisk projects were not included Examples of other types of initiativeseg electronic text and image database projectsare mentioned in a few instances in order to highlight the range of activity underway Projects are listed only once even if they might logically fit under several headings The report concludes with a section that describes several significant projects aimed at defining and improving the existing infrastructure for on line access to information It also mentions some noteworthy Websites that lead to

project in 1994 approximately 55000 posters were photographed as slides and then digitized The collection was also organized and cataloged to promote easy access to the entire body of posters in any subject category The Judaica Division has plans to supplement this project by imaging 20000 photographs of Israeli religious posters in collaboration with an Israeli sociologist who photographs these posters as part of his research The Division has also placed its slide collection of 6000 images on photo CD and will add about 1000 maps as well Contact Violet Gilboa or Charles Berlin Harvard

Preservation and Access 1400 16th Street NW Suite 740 Washington DC 200362217 and the National Media Laboratory Building 2351N17 St Paul MN 551441000 This report is a joint project of the Commission on Preservation and Access and the National Media Laboratory developed within the Commissions Preservation Science Research initiative The initiative encourages new techniques and technologies to manage chemical deterioration in library and archival collections and to extend their useful life Preface This report from the National Media Laboratory NML helps clarify longterm storage requirements for magnetic media The information is derived from the industrys accumulated knowledge base plus media stability studies and operations support activities conducted by the NML for the U S Government advanced data recording community Clearly the purpose and scope of longterm magnetic media storage issues for libraries and archives are different from those of many Government operations but the basics remain the same The report focuses on how to properly store and care for magnetic media to maximize their life expectancies However it provides more than a howto guide The author includes technical explanations for the rationale behind recommended procedures written specifically for librarians historians records managers archivists and others who do not have a significant background in recording technology In addition the report is useful for decisionmaking and costbenefit analyses for managers and administrators who have responsibility for the longterm preservation of information stored on magnetic media Authors Acknowledgments The author wishes to thank Devora Molitor Peg Wetzel Chris Ward and Jim Druzik for their discerning comments notable suggestions and assistance in preparing this manuscript Introduction The use of magnetic media to record and store numeric and textual information sound motion and still images has presented librarians and archivists with opportunities and challenges On the one hand magnetic media increase the kinds of artifacts and events we can capture and store On the other hand their special longterm storage needs are different from traditional library materials confusing to those in charge of their care and demanding of resources not always available to libraries and archives Audio and video collections require specific care and handling to ensure that the recorded information will be preserved Special storage environments may be required if the recorded information is to be preserved for longer than ten years For information that must be preserved indefinitely periodic transcription from old media to new media will be necessary not only because the media are unstable but because the recording technology will become obsolete 11 Magnetic Media Compared to Paper and Film As an information storage medium magnetic tape is not as stable as film or paper Properly cared for film and nonacidic paper can last for centuries whereas magnetic tape will only last a few decades Use of magnetic media for storage is further confounded by the prevalence of several formats eg Umatic VHS SVHS 8mm and BetaCam for video media types iron oxide chromium dioxide barium ferrite metal particulate and metal evaporated and by rapid advances in media technology On the other hand books have virtually maintained the same format for centuries have almost exclusively used ink on paper as the information storage medium and require no special technology to access the recorded information Likewise newer microfilm microfiche and movie film are known for their stability when kept in proper environments and viewing formats have not changed significantly over the years The breakdown of acetate backing that plagues older film materials is discussed in Section 23 Substrate Deformation This report will compare care and handling procedures for tapes with procedures for paper and film whenever possible 12 The Scope of the Report As noted previously this report is concerned with the proper care and handling of tapes to prevent information loss Tape recording technology consists of two independent components the magnetic tape and the recorder Neither component is designed to last forever Information recorded on a tape can be lost because of chemical degradation of the tape However access to information on a tape can also be lost because the format has become obsolete and a working recorder cannot be located This document concentrates on preservation of the tape and mentions recorders only when needed to understand the safekeeping of tape Care maintenance and preservation of recorders is beyond the scope of this report Likewise the subject of disaster recovery is beyond the scope of this document Recovery from a collectionwide disaster is best accomplished with the assistance of an expert in tape degradation who can examine the whole collection and recommend a recovery procedure that may require special equipment A few contacts for diagnosing and treating deteriorating tape collections are provided at the end of this document The handling practices discussed in this document are applicable to all audio and videotape collectionsthose accessed daily and those stored in an archive If a particular recommendation is appropriate for only one type of storage it will be indicated as such Otherwise it can be assumed that the recommendations herein apply to both types of tape collections those accessed daily and those archived for preservation In this report the audio or video program recorded on the tape is referred to as information For example the information recorded on an audio tape could be a sound studio recording a concert performance radio news broadcasts a college lecture or songbird calls The information recorded on a videotape could be a TV program a movie a childs recital a videotaped interview an artists original work or a surveillance camera record To help understand some of the terminology associated with the magnetic recording field a Glossary is provided Words included in the Glossary appear in italics the first time they are referenced What Can Go Wrong with Magnetic Media Magnetic tape consists of a thin layer capable of recording a magnetic signal supported by a thicker film backing The magnetic layer or top coat consists of a magnetic pigment suspended within a polymer binder As its name implies the binder holds the magnetic particles together and to the tape backing The structure of the top coat of a magnetic tape is similar to the structure of JellO that contains fruit the pigment fruit is suspended in and held together by the binder JellO The top coat or magnetic layer is responsible for recording and storing the magnetic signals written to it aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure1gifapos relativeurl Figure 1 Diagram of a Tape Reel A schematic of a tape reel showing the principal components Tape is wound around the hub of a tape reel forming a tape pack The tape pack is protected from damage and disruption by flanges on the reel The binder also has the function of providing a smooth surface to facilitate transportation of the tape through the recording system during the record and playback processes Without the binder the tape surface would be very rough like sandpaper Other components are added to the binder to help transport the tape and facilitate information playback A lubricant is added to the binder to reduce friction which reduces the tension needed to transport the tape through the recorder and also reduces tape wear A head cleaning agent is added to the binder to reduce the occurrence of head clogs that result in dropouts Carbon black is also added to reduce static charges which attract debris to the tape The backing film or substrate is needed to support the magnetic recording layer which is too thin and weak to be a standalone film layer In some tape systems a back coat is applied to the backside of the tape substrate layer A back coat reduces tape friction dissipates static charge and reduces tape distortion by providing a more uniform tape pack wind on the tape reel Figure 1 A schematic diagram of a magnetic tape construction is shown in Figure 2 Figure 2 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure2gifapos relativeurl Figure 2 Cross Section of Magnetic Tape Magnetic particles are held together with a binder coated on a film substrate Lubricant and other agents not shown may also be included in the top coat layer A back coat may also be added to control friction and static charges The structure of the top coat is analogous to that of JellO filled with grapes where the grapes represented the magnetic particles and the JellO represented the binder All three tape components magnetic particle binder and backing are potential sources of failure for a magnetic tape medium The MagneticMedia Industries Association of Japan MIAJ has concluded that the shelf life of magnetic tape under normal conditions is controlled by the binder rather than the magnetic particles DDS Specs Drive DAT Reliability Computer Technology Review 13 5 May 1993 30 In this instance the shelf life would refer both to the life of recorded as well as unrecorded media the life of the binder is independent of whether or not the tape has ever been recorded 21 Binder Degradation The binder is responsible for holding the magnetic particles on the tape and facilitating tape transport If the binder loses integrity through softening embrittlement loss of cohesiveness or loss of lubrication the tape may become unplayable Sticky tape and sticky shed are commonly used terms to describe the phenomenon associated with deterioration of the magnetic tape binder The binder polymers used in magnetic tape constructions are subject to a chemical process known as hydrolysis In this process long molecules are broken apart by a reaction with water to produce shorter molecules The shorter molecules do not impart the same degree of integrity to the binder system as do the longer molecules As in a wool sweater if enough individual yarns are cut the sweater will eventually fall apart Specifically it is the polyester linkages in the commonly used polyester polyurethanebased binder systems that undergo scission are broken by water molecules Water must be present for the hydrolysis reaction to occur Furthermore the more water that is present the more likely it is that polyester chains will be broken The binder polymer will absorb water from the air It will absorb more water in a high humidity environment than a low humidity one This process is analogous to that observed for open bags of crackers potato chips and breakfast cereals They will loose their crunch quickly on humid summer days 80 to 90 RH as they absorb high amounts of moisture from the air In the winter however indoor humidities generally can be lower 10 to 20 RH less moisture is absorbed from the air and the snacks never seem to get as stale Binder hydrolysis can lead to a sticky tape phenomenon characterized by a softer than normal binder coating higher friction andor gummy tape surface residues A sticky tape can exhibit sticky shed produce head clogs result in stick slip playback and in extreme cases seize and stop in the tape transport Tape binder debris resulting from binder deterioration will result in head clogs that will produce dropouts on a VHS tape when played back The sticky tape syndrome will result in the squealing of audio tapes as the tape very rapidly sticks to and releases from the playback head Procedures such as tape baking can temporarily improve binder integrity allowing sticky tapes to be played and data recovered The Ampex Recording Media Corporation reports that treating a sticky tape at 122 F 50 C for three days will sufficiently firm up the binder coating so that the tape can be played The effect of the treatment is temporary and it is recommended that the information on the treated tape be transcribed to new tape within one to two weeks Tape baking should not be considered a universal panacea for the treatment of sticky tapes The tape baking procedure was developed for a specific type of degradation phenomenon on specific tape types hydrolysis of reeltoreel audio tapes and computer tapes For other kinds of degradation on other tape types tape baking may actually cause more damage Expert advice is recommended Lubricant Loss Lubricants are normally added to the binder to reduce the friction of the magnetic topcoat layer of the tape Lower friction will facilitate tape transport through the recorder and reduce tape wear In a VHS recorder where the tape is wrapped around a rapidly rotating head low friction is also important as it prevents overheating of the tape The surface of a magnetic tape is actually quite porous In some tapes a liquid lubricant is added to the binder and will reside in these pores similar to water absorbed in a wet sponge When the tape passes over a head or a tape guide lubricant is squeezed out onto the tape surface providing a slippery interface between the tape and the guide pin After passing by the guide pin the excess lubricant on the surface of the tape is absorbed back into the surface of the tape The phenomenon is similar to that observed when the surface of a wet sponge is gently pressed and released water is exuded to the surface when the sponge is pressed and is reabsorbed when the pressure is released Over time the level of lubricant in the tape decreases Lubricants are partially consumed every time the tape is played This is all part of their job as lubricants they are consumed and worn down sacrificially to protect the tape Some of the lubricant will migrate from the tape to the guide pins and heads of the recorder each time the tape is played Lubricant levels decrease over time even in unplayed archived tape as a result of evaporation and degradation The lubricants used in some tapes are oily liquids that are volatile and slowly evaporate away over time Some lubricants are also subject to degradation by hydrolysis and oxidation just like the binder polymer and will lose their essential lubrication properties with time The information stored on severely degraded magnetic tapes can be recovered in specific instances after relubrication of the tapes By significantly reducing the friction of the magnetic coating with the addition of lubricant tapes can be made to play back Prior to relubrication the tape may have seized in the tape transport as a result of high friction or the magnetic coating may have been readily torn off the tape backing by a high speed tape head Relubrication of tapes must be done carefully by experienced individuals If a tape is overlubricated the excess lubricant on the surface of the tape will act as debris and increase the headtotape spacing causing signal losses and dropouts 22 Magnetic Particle Instabilities The magnetic particle or pigment the terminology is a carryover from paint and coatings technology is responsible for storing recorded information magnetically as changes in the direction of the magnetism of local particles If there is any change in the magnetic properties of the pigment recorded signals can be irretrievably lost The magnetic remanence characterizes the pigments ability to retain a magnetic field It refers to the amount of signal that remains after a recording process The strength of the signal recorded on a tape magnetically is directly related to the magnetic remanence of the pigment Thus a decrease in the magnetic remanence of the pigment over time can result in a lowered output signal and potential information loss The coercivity characterizes the pigments ability to resist demagnetization It refers to the strength of the magnetic field that must be applied to a magnetic particle in order to coerce it to change the direction of its magnetic field Demagnetization of a tape can result from an externally applied field such as that produced by a handheld metal detector at an airport security check point A magnetic tape with a lower coercivity is more susceptible to demagnetization and signal loss Magnetic pigments differ in their stability some particles retain their magnetic properties longer than others Thus some tapes will retain information which is stored magnetically longer than others Iron oxide and cobaltmodified iron oxide pigments are the most stable pigment types of those used in audio and videotapes These pigments are generally used in the lower grade audio and low to high grade VHSBeta videotape formulations The low coercivity of these pigments disallows their use in high grade audio formulations Metal particulate MP and chromium dioxide CrO2 pigments provide a higher tape signal output and permit higher recording frequencies than the iron oxide pigments but are not as stable as the iron oxide pigments A decrease in signal output of two decibel dB may be observed over the lifetime of metal particle and chromium dioxide based tapes However even with these losses the output signal will still be better than a comparable iron oxide based tape A loss in signal will manifest itself as a reduction in the clarity and volume of a sound recording and in the loss of hue and reduction in saturation for a video recording Chromium dioxide is used in medium to high grade audio tape and some high grade VHSBeta video tape Metal particulate is used in high grade audio and 8mm video tape Metal particulate is also used in most digital audio and digital video tape formulations The type of pigment used in the audio or video tape formulations is normally indicated in the product literature that comes with the tape This information can also be obtained from the manufacturer via the tollfree number provided on the literature that accompanies the tape cassette or reel There is not much that can be done to prevent the magnetic deterioration that is inherent in the metal particulate and chromium dioxide pigment types However the rate of deterioration can be slowed by storing the tapes in cooler temperatures The level of humidity has little direct effect on the deterioration of magnetic pigments However byproducts of binder deterioration can accelerate the rate of pigment deterioration so lower humidity would also be preferred to minimize the degradation of the magnetic pigment Metal evaporated ME video tapes are prevalent in the 8mm video formats These tapes require no binder polymer as the entire magnetic layer consists of a single homogeneous metal alloy layer that is evaporated onto the tape substrate These tapes have chemical stabilities similar to those of metal particle tapes However because the magnetic coating on an ME tape is much thinner than the corresponding layer on an MP tape they are generally not as durable and do not hold up well in repeated play or freezeframe video applications 23 Substrate Deformation The tape backing or substrate supports the magnetic layer for transportation through the recorder Since the early 1960s audio tapes and videotapes have used an oriented polyester also known as polyethylene terephthalate PET or DuPont Mylar film as a tape substrate material Polyester has been shown both experimentally and in practice to be chemically stable Polyester films are highly resistant to oxidation and hydrolysis In archival situations the polyester tape backing will chemically outlast the binder polymer The problem with polyester backed videotapes is that excessive tape pack stresses aging and poor wind quality can result in distortions and subsequent mistracking when the tapes are played The best way to reduce the degree of tape backing distortion is to store magnetic media in an environment that does not vary much in temperature or humidity Each time the temperature or humidity changes the tape pack will undergo expansion or contraction These dimensional changes can increase the stresses in the tape pack that can cause permanent distortion of the tape backing Distortion of a VHS tape backing will show up as mistracking when the tape is played Tape backing deformation can also arise if the tape experiences nonlinear deformation as a result of nonuniform tape pack stresses This normally results if the tape pack wind quality is poor as indicated by popped strands of tape one to several strands of tape protruding from the edge of a wound roll of tape Methods of controlling the quality of the tape pack wind are discussed in the Ampex Guide to the Care and Handling of Magnetic Tape that appears in the Appendix Older tapes used other backing materials In the 1940s and 1950s acetate cellulose acetate cellulose triacetate film was used as an audio tape backing This is the same material used in some older movie film In general if light can be seen coming through the tape windings when the reel is held up to a light it is an acetate based magnetic tape This substrate is subject to hydrolysis and is not as stable as polyester film However more stable vinyl binder systems were used during this time period Thus the life of tapes produced during this period can be limited by the degradation of the backing rather than the binder Degradation of the backing in these tapes is indicated by the presence of the vinegar syndrome where a faint odor of vinegar acetic acid can be detected coming from the tapes In the advanced stages of degradation the magnetic tape will become brittle and break easily if bent too sharply or tugged The backing also shrinks as it decomposes resulting in a change in the length of the recording Any tape on an acetate backing should be stored in a lowtemperature lowhumidity archive to reduce the rate of deterioration of the acetate tape backing Acetete film has also been used as a base film for photographic film cinema film and microfilm The IPI Storage Guide for Acetate Film has been prepared by the Image Permanence Institute Rochester Institute of Technology Post Office Box 9887 Rochester New York 146230887 Phone 7164755199 as an aid in preserving still and motion picture film collections on acetate base films The comments in that guide are equally appropriate for acetate based magnetic recording tape In general lower storage temperatures and relative humidities are recommended to increase the time to onset of the vinegar syndrome Tapes having the vinegar syndrome should be stored separately to prevent the contamination of other archive materials by acetic acid After the onset of the vinegar syndrome acetate films degrade at an accelerated rate Tapes that have been stable for fifty years may degrade to the point of being unplayable in just a few years Any valuable tape showing vinegar syndrome should be transcribed as soon as possible Prior to cellulose acetate paper was used as a tape backing material Audio recordings of this type are very rare and should be stored in a tape archive Although generally stable these backings are very fragile and subject to tearing or breaking on playback For this reason particular care should be taken to ensure that the playback recorder is very well maintained 24 Format Issues Helical versus Longitudinal Scan Recording The susceptibility of the recording to loss as a result of dimensional changes in the backing is dependent on recording format Videotape which uses a helical scan recording format is more sensitive to disproportionate dimensional changes in the backing than analog audio tape which uses longitudinal recording Helical Figure 3 Tracks are recorded diagonally on a helical scan tape at small scan angles When the dimensions of the backing change disproportionately the track angle will change for a helical scan recording The scan angle for the recordplayback head is fixed If the angle that the recorded tracks make to the edge of the tape do not correspond with the scan angle of the head mistracking and information loss can occur Distortion of a helical scan videotape can result in two types of mistracking trapezoidal and curvature Figure 4 In trapezoidal mistracking the tracks remain linear but the track angle changes so that the playback head which is always at a fixed angle to the tape cannot follow them Curvature mistracking can be a more serious type of deformation where the recorded tracks become curved as a result of nonlinear deformation of the tape backing Mistracking will result in a video image where some or all of the screen is snowy or distorted For example in the case of trapezoidal mistracking the upper portion of the TV screen may appear normal whereas the lower portion of the screen may be all static The appearance on the screen will be similar to the playback of a good tape where the tracking adjustment control has been purposely misadjusted Figure 3 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure3gifapos relativeurl Figure 3 Helical Scan Recording A moving tape wraps 180 around a cylindrical drum rotating at high speeds the rotating head is oriented at a slight angle to the tape so that the tracks written by the tiny record head embedded in the surface of the rotating drum run diagonally across the tape from one side to the other Figure 4 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure4gifapos relativeurl Figure 4 Types of Mistracking for Helical Scan Recording Trapezoidal error occurs when the angle of the recorded track does not agree with the scan angle of the playback head Curvature error occurs when the tape has deformed nonlinearly The playback signal corresponds to that for a single helical scan Longitudinal Figure 5 In a longitudinal tape system the heads are arranged along a fixed head stack one head per track and the tracks will always remain parallel to the edge of the tape Mistracking is not as great a problem in longitudinal recording for this reason Distortion of a longitudinal audio recording tape will appear as a temporary muffling change in pitch or loss of the audio track Distortion of the tape backing can impart a slight curve to the normally linear tape When the distorted portion of tape passes over the playback head the recorded tracks can move out of alignment with the head gap causing a temporary reduction in sound volume and quality Figure 5 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure5gifapos relativeurl Figure 5 Longitudinal Recording A moving tape passes across a stationary record head The recorded tracks are parallel to the edge of the tape and run the full length of the tape A ninetrack tape is shown Analog versus Digital Storage Some comments concerning the archival stability of analog versus digital materials may be instructive In an analog recording the signal recorded on the audio or videotape is a representation of the signal originally heard or seen by the microphone or video camera The volume of a sound recording or the intensity of the color of a video image is directly related to the strength of the magnetic signal recorded on the tape In a digital recording the audio or video source signal is digitized the signal is sampled at specific points in time and converted to a number that reflects the intensity of the signal at the time of sampling analogtodigital conversion These numbers in binary form are written to the tape rather than the analog signal On playback the numbers are read and used to reconstruct a signal that is representative of the original signal digitaltoanalog conversion The chief advantage of an analog recording for archival purposes is that the deterioration over time is gradual and discernible This allows the tape to be transcribed before it reaches a point where the recording quality has degraded to an unusable level Even in instances of severe tape degradation where sound or video quality is severely compromised by tape squealing or a high rate of dropouts some portion of the original recording will still be perceptible A digitally recorded tape will show little if any deterioration in quality up to the time of catastrophic failure when large sections of recorded information will be completely missing None of the original material will be detectable in these missing sections The chief advantage of a digital recording is that copies of the original tape can be made without any loss in recording quality A copy of a digital tape can be made that is truly identical to the original source tape When an analog tape is copied the original information signal is actually copied along with any tape noise inherent in the tape and any electronic noise inherent in the recording device This will be written to a new tape that also has its own level of inherent tape noise Therefore the noise level on the dubbed copy will always be greater than that on the original tape or the sound quality of the original recording will be altered as it is filtered to reduce noise The presence of noise in the recording will make the recorded information less distinct to see or hear Recording engineers refer to a signaltonoise ratio which defines the quality of the recording with a higher value being better Digital tape recordings are virtually unaffected by tape noise even though digital tapes are not noise free In digital recording binary numbers comprised entirely of ones and zeros are read from and written to the tape The ones and zeros are easily distinguished from the background noise In an analog recording the recorder cannot distinguish between the recorded signal and the tape noise so that both are read and reproduced on playback In addition digital recordings usually have an error correction system that uses redundant bits to reconstruct areas of lost signal Analog recording continuously records the complete signal heard or seen by the recording microphone or video camera However distortion in both recording and playback will vary with the quality of the electronic components used In digital recording the source signal is quantized to a fixed number of allowed signal levels For example a video image quantized at 8bitscolor would only allow for 256 distinct colors to be reproduced whereas an analog image would allow an infinite number of colors By increasing the number of bitscolor used the number of color levels that can be reproduced will increase see bit in the Glossary for more detail For example an image quantized at 24bitscolor will allow 16777216 distinct colors With digital recording higher quality video images require greater storage volumes Some audiophiles with highly trained ears claim that they can hear limitations in a digital CD audio recording 16bit quantization permitting 65536 distinct sound levels and a maximum frequency of 22 kHz when compared to an analog recording of the same sound source Analog tape recordings do not require expensive equipment for recording and playing Digital audio and video equipment which records high frequencies at high speeds and performs the complex tasks of analogtodigital and digitaltoanalog conversion and error correction is relatively expensive 25 Magnetic Tape Recorders This document is primarily concerned with tape media not tape recorders However in discussing what can go wrong with media recorders must be mentioned Audio and video recorders must be maintained in excellent condition in order to produce high quality recordings and to prevent damage to tapes on playback Dirty recorders can ruin tape by distributing debris across the surface of the tape and scratching the tape Recorders that are not mechanically aligned can tear and stretch tape produce poor tape packs and write poorly placed tracks Recorders that are poorly aligned electrically can cause signal problems that will result in inferior playback Follow the manufacturers instructions for good recorder maintenance in order to protect recordings 3 Preventing Information Loss Multiple Tape Copies As already discussed this report is primarily concerned with preventing magnetic tape from degrading prematurely However it is worth mentioning the use of multiple copies as another strategy for preventing loss of information Recorded information can be lost because the medium on which it is recorded has deteriorated to the point of being unplayable Information can also be lost if the tape on which it is recorded disappears misplaced stolen destroyed by fire or flooding and so forth Both types of loss can be prevented by maintaining more than one copy of the information and storing all copies in separate locations If funds are available it is preferable to maintain both access storage and archival storage of important information As the names imply the access environment keeps the recording readily available for playback Archive storage involves a separate environment designed to maximize the longevity of the tape Refer to Section 52 Storage Conditions and Standards for a more detailed discussion of these storage conditions The quality of care a magnetic tape receives should be commensurate with the perceived value of the information contained on the tape Refer to Section 41 Tape Costs and Longevity for more information In reality a library or archive may not have the budget the personnel the time or the space to maintain two copies of all of the recordings in a video or audio tape collection In this case the value and use requirements of individual tapes in the collection should be assessed and prioritized Those tapes considered the most valuable and most likely to be used should be duplicated and the originals should be placed in an archive environment If duplicates of information are disallowed some or all of the collection could be placed in an archive but this would greatly limit access to the information In instances where the information is considered extremely valuable it may be worthwhile to maintain several copies of the original in the archive along with the original tape 4 Life Expectancy How Long Will Magnetic Media Last Unfortunately media life expectancy LE information is largely undocumented and a standard method for determining magnetic media lifetimes has yet to be established The need for this information fuels the ongoing NML media stability studies which have incorporated accelerated temperaturehumidity and corrosion environments to measure performance over time and to develop models to forecast extended media lifetimes A simple example as to how LEs can be determined is provided in the Appendix under Estimation of Magnetic Tape Life Expectancies LEs According to manufacturers data sheets and other technical literature thirty years appears to be the upper limit for magnetic tape products including video and audio tapes LE values for storage media however are similar to miles per gallon ratings for automobiles Your actual mileage may vary Recently articles have been appearing which suggest that the life expectancy of magnetic media is much shorter than originally thought For example an article in the January 1995 Scientific American Jeff Rothenberg Ensuring the Longevity of Digital Documents conservatively estimated the physical lifetime of digital magnetic recording tape at one year Because of the confusion that can result from such a statement NML officially responded with a letter to the editor that appeared in the June 1995 issue of Scientific American The letter states that the physical lifetimes for digital magnetic tape are at least 10 to 20 years 41 Tape Costs and Longevity Some people assess storage media solely in terms of media cost This view assumes that the sound images or information stored on the media have no intrinsic value However a storage medium should be evaluated in terms of the cost of losing the recorded information in the event that the storage medium degrades irreversibly The value of the tape cassette must be equated with the cost of preserving the data When the cost of losing the information is considered it may be economically justified to invest more in a mediumsystem of proven reliability It may also warrant the cost of making and keeping replicated copies of original data and stockpiling systems to play back the data at future times When purchasing media of a specific format some archivists are required to deal with a procurement bidding process In most cases the archivist will end up with the lowest bidders media which may not be the best media Tape manufacturers products differ in coating thickness magnetic particle stability and durability Procurement specifications should exclude the poorer media The vendor should be asked for experimental proof of the stability of the media if the tape is to be used for archival storage 42 Practical Life Expectancies Those accustomed to storing paper and microfilm may be annoyed by the relatively short life expectancies ten to thirty years of magnetic tape materials Some gold platedglass substrate digital optical disc technologies promise 100year lifetimes However a 100year life expectancy is irrelevant when the system technology may be in use for no more than ten or twenty years or less Audio and video recording technologies are advancing at a much faster rate than printing and microfilming technologies We are fortunate if a recording technology stays current for more than twenty years In the case of a magnetic recording media with a fiftyyear life expectancy the media would undoubtedly outlive the recording system technology To truly achieve a fiftyyear archival life recording systems sufficient spare parts and technical manuals would need to be archived along with the recorded media In the case of audio and video archives transcription is inevitable Rather than trying to preserve old outdated recording formats and technologies it may be more practical to transcribe on a regular basis every ten to twenty years or even more frequently The old copy could be preserved until the new copy is transcribed to the next generation of recording system In this fashion at least two copies of the material are always in existence 5 How Can You Prevent Magnetic Tape from Degrading Prematurely The remainder of this document answers this question Some of the factors to be discussed are more controllable than others For example you can normally decide the storage conditions and level of access to an archive collection However you do not always have control over the quality of the tape wind or the brand type and format of the tape media on which the information is stored Factors affecting the life of the tape over which you have some control are The care with which it is handled and shipped discussed in Section 51 Care and Handling The quality of the conditions in which it is stored discussed in Section 52 Storage Conditions and Standards The number of times the tape is accessed during its lifetime discussed in Section 51 Care and Handling Frequent Access Other factors that affect media over which you have less control are The physical components of the tape discussed in Section 2 What Can Go Wrong with Magnetic Media The quality of the tape being purchased for example standard grade versus high grade VHS Variation in the quality of the manufacturer for example a name brand versus a bargain brand Future availability of system technology to play back the tape For example quadruplex videotapes still exist in archives however the equipment to play them back is considered obsolete and it is difficult to find working recorders 51 Care and Handling Magnetic tape should receive the same kind of care that you would give to a valuable book or important photograph In general handle the tapes with care keep them clean and apply common sense Use and store magnetic tape reels and cassettes in a clean environment Avoid contamination of the tapes by dirt dust fingerprints food cigarette smoke and ash and airborne pollutants Take care not to drop tapes or cartridges Keep tapes out of strong sunlight and avoid contact with water Do not store tapes on radiators window sills televisions electronic equipment or machinery When the tapes are not in use they should be placed back on the storage shelf and stored on end They should not be allowed to lay flat reel flanges parallel with the table top for extended periods of time Refer to the Ampex Guide in the Appendix for more information Magnetic tapes do require some unique care and handling precautions Because they are a magnetic form of storage exposure to strong magnetic fields must be avoided to prevent information loss This is generally not a problem unless the materials need to be transported or shipped Frequent Access Tapes that are frequently accessed may have a reduced life expectancy due to wear and tear The life of the media may not be determined by data error rates but by the life of the media housing In one instance the life of a tape cassette was limited by failure of the cassette door not because of any fault of the tape media How many insert and eject cycles will your media be required to handle This may limit the life of the cassette The more a tape or cassette is handled the more it is contaminated with fingerprints and debris It is also exposed to less than ideal conditions especially if the materials are removed from the building in which they are normally stored Every time a VHS cassette is loaded into a recorder the recorder mechanism pulls tape from the cassette This mechanism can damage the tape if the guide pins are not properly aligned Debris on the loading mechanism can scratch the surface of the tape Also when a tape is removed from a recorder the tape must properly retract into the cassette otherwise it will be damaged when the cassette doors close and the tape cassette is ejected from the recorder Most of us have probably had experience with a VHS deck that has eaten a tape Because of potential damage to the tape it is important that the tapes be inserted and ejected at areas of the tape that contain no recorded information A tape should NEVER be ejected in the middle of an important recording Transportation of Magnetic Tape Care must be exercised to ensure that tape collections are not harmed when they are transported When magnetic media are transported temperatures should not exceed 110 F 43 C Collections should be transported in the spring or the fall when outdoor temperatures are moderate if possible Properly wound tape reels can survive greater variations in temperature and humidity without permanent damage than can poorly wound tape packs Tapes and cassettes should be shipped in the same orientation as they are stored on edge with the weight of the tape pack being supported by the reel hub Tapes that are shipped in the flat position are particularly subject to damage from dropping and other forms of shock This is especially true of tapes that experience large changes in temperature during shipment or tapes that are poorly wound Media should be protected from damage due to shock by packing them in materials that will absorb shock special packages bubble wrap using special labeling and transporting them in appropriate vehicles Shockabsorbing packaging will often have the added advantage of providing insulation that helps protect the media from large swings in temperature and humidity Exposure to strong magnetic fields must also be avoided to prevent information loss Some of the detectors used to screen luggage in overseas airports have been known to partially erase tapes Walk through metal detectors and Xray scanners do not pose a threat to recorded information Some handheld metal detectors can cause problems since they use strong magnetic fields Refer to the section on Stray Magnetism in the Ampex Guide in the Appendix 52 Storage Conditions and Standards Storing magnetic tape in a clean controlled environment is the most important precaution you can take to extend the life of the media High temperatures high humidity and the presence of dust and corrosive elements in the air all affect the physical components that make up magnetic tape and can result in loss of readable data through decreased magnetic capability and deterioration of the binder or backing of the tape Too low temperatures should also be avoided In some cases temperatures lower than 32 F 0 C may actually harm the media and shorten rather than extend life expectancies by risking exudation of the lubricant from the binder which may clog heads Rapid temperature changes are also undesirable as they introduce stresses in the wound tape pack Tapes that are to be played in an environment different from the storage environment should be allowed to acclimate to the new temperature Temperature and Relative Humidity For years tape manufacturers have recommended that you store your tapes in a cool dry place In Section 2 What Can Go Wrong with Magnetic Tape the reasons behind this dictum were discussed in terms of the chemistries of the tape components Binder hydrolysis is dependent on the moisture content of the tape and lower humidity results in lower rates of hydrolysis Furthermore this reaction will proceed more slowly at lower temperatures The latter is also true for the magnetic pigments they will degrade more slowly at lower temperatures Finally to reduce unnecessary stresses on the wound tape that could result in deformation of the backing a limited variation in temperatures and humidities is recommended See Figure 6 Storage at high temperatures gt 74 F gt 23 C increases tape pack tightness This results in distortion of the tape backing and an increase in permanent dropouts as woundin debris is forced into the tape magnetic layer Many layers of tape before and after the debris can be affected by impressions of the debris Layer to layer adhesion known as tape blocking also can result after long term storage at elevated temperatures Storage at high humidity gt 70 RH results in increased degradation of the binder as a result of the higher moisture content of the tape pack High humidities will also cause increased tape pack stresses as the tape absorbs moisture from the air and expands causing distortion of the tape backing and an increase in permanent dropouts Fungal growth is also possible at high humidities and temperatures Molds can live off the binder polymer and added components This is yet another cause of binder breakdown in high humidities Hairy growths at the edges of the tape are a sign of mold The spores that are produced on this fuzz can get onto the tape surface and cause many dropouts Changes in both temperature and humidity can also cause mistracking problems on helical scan recordings See Section 24 Format Issues Helical versus Longitudinal Scan Recording Substrates will expand or shrink with changing temperature and humidity just as metals do in heat or cold The substrate films are not completely balanced in their reaction to these changes in temperature and humidity In other words they stretch and shrink differently in length and width directions This causes a change in the angle of the recorded helical scan tracks Most of these changes are recoverable by returning to a temperature and humidity close to the one at which the tape was recorded However heat can also cause premature aging of the substrate in the form of nonrecoverable shrinking and stretching Figure 6 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure6gifapos relativeurl Figure 6 Temperature and Humidity Conditions and Risk of Hydrolysis This figure depicts the effects of humidity and temperature and shows that 15 3 C 59 5 F and 40 maximum relative humidity RH are safe practical storage conditions A similar diagram appears in ISO TR 63711989 that suggests even more stringent conditions RH 20 max for longterm storage of instrumentation tapes Source Ampex Reprinted with permission Variations in Temperature and Humidity Generally the temperature and humidity in a tape storage facility are set to specific values or set points and infrequently varied or adjusted This does not mean that the temperature and humidity in the facility are invariant Changes in the outdoor temperature and humidity will cause the temperature in the tape storage facility to vary slightly If the temperature outdoors is higher than the set point temperature in the facility the actual temperature in the facility will be slightly higher than the set point If the outdoor temperature is lower than the set temperature the actual facility temperature will be lower than the set point The variations in temperature experienced will be larger at larger distances from the thermostat in the facility The same logic applies to the humidity level in the facility Larger discrepancies in the set point and the actual temperature will be observed if one of the walls of the facility is an exterior wall or if the heatingcooling capacity of the environmental controller is less than that required to properly control the tape archive The set point in a tape archive may be constant but the archive will still experience some degree of daily and seasonal variations in temperature and humidity A tape archivist must have knowledge of the set points in the archive as well as the variations in temperature and humidity to ensure that the archive complies with recommended storage conditions Variations in temperature and humidity can cause tape problems Tape packs are wound under a considerable amount of tension This is necessary to maintain the shape of the tape pack A reel of tape can be permanently damaged if the tape pack tension is too high or too low If the tension is too high the tape backing can stretch If the tension gets too low tape layers can slip past each other resulting in pack slip cinching or popped strands on playback see Figure 7 Relaxation of the tape backing can also occur if the tape pack tension is not properly maintained Relaxation stretching and deformation of the tape backing can cause mistracking of a videotape or sound distortion on an audio tape Every time a tape pack is heated or cooled the tape pack tension will increase or decrease respectively The best way to reduce the degree of tape backing distortion is to store magnetic media in an environment that does not vary much in temperature or humidity Figure 7 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure7gifapos relativeurl Figure 7 Bad Tape Wind Examples This figure shows schematic examples of popped strands pack slip and a flange pack The illustrations show a crosssection slice of the tape pack through the hub Dust and Debris Dust smoke particles and tape debris present in the environment can get wound into the tape pack as the tape is played resulting in dropouts when the tape is subsequently played The lost signal is generally greater than expected from the size of the particle The record and read heads must maintain very close contact with the tape A particle of dust on the tape causes the head to ride up over the particle and lose contact with the tape For perspective on the size of various debris particles compared to the normal head to tape spacing see Figure 8 Figure 8 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure8gifapos relativeurl Figure 8 Size of Tape Debris Relative to the TapeHead Spacing This figure shows the relative size of debris commonly found on tapes and on recorders relative to the tapehead spacing It is clear from this diagram that even the smallest airborne particles can result in a dropout if the debris gets between the head and the tape Corrosive Gases Polluted air is known to cause problems with books photographs and works of art Airborne sulfides ozone and nitrous oxides can cause accelerated deterioration of these objects Silverware and black and white photographs are blackened by airborne sulfides produced by the degradation of wool fibers the burning of coal and bioeffluents Magnetic tapes are no exception They too are susceptible to corrosive gases in the environment Exposure to very low levels of corrosive gases representative of urban office environments has been known to cause corrosion on bare metal particle MP and metal evaporated ME tapes In general these tapes are contained in cassettes and the cassette shells have been shown to be an effective armor against pollutants in the environment This corrosion problem is limited to the metal based MP and ME tapes and is not a significant factor in the deterioration of oxide tapes iron oxide chromium dioxide barium ferrite If a tape archive is known to contain MP or ME based magnetic tapes and the tape archive is situated in an environment characterized by high levels of pollutants eg downtown Los Angeles some precautions may be necessary to ensure that the level of chlorine and sulfides in the archive are at a sufficiently low level Air conditioning systems may require special filters to remove pollutants if the archive is located in an urban environment Storage Recommendations Current industry standards recommend that materials be stored around 65 70 F 18 21 C and 40 50 relative humidity RH Table 1 Unfortunately these recommendations are based in part on what is best for recording and playback and what has historically proven to be good for film and paper storage They may not be the best conditions for the longterm storage of magnetic media Standards committees are beginning to consider storage conditions specific to magnetic tape and are recognizing that magnetic tapes benefit from storage at temperatures and humidities lower than those recommended in the past AgencyResearcher Date Temperature Relative Humidity Cuddihy 1982 65F 3F 18C 2C 40 5 SMPTE RP103 1982 70F 4F 21C 2C 50 20 NARA 1990 65F 3F 18C 2C 40 5 Table 1 Current Recommendations for Magnetic Tape Storage Note These are general recommendations that were being made in the 1980s Standards committees are beginning to recognize the benefits of lower humidities and temperatures for the long term storage of magnetic tape The above conditions may not be optimal for preserving magnetic tape for as long as is physically possible AES ANSI NARA and SMPTE standards committees are coming to recognize that organizations have different storage needs and requirements In some cases information older than five years is considered obsolete In other cases information needs to be preserved in perpetuity The optimal storage conditions for each of these requirements differs Table 2 In the case of shortlived information storage conditions can be at or near the room ambient conditions of the facility in which the tape collection is housed No special storage facilities would be required assuming that temperatures stayed between 68 76 F 20 24 C year round and humidity never exceeded 55 RH For the indefinite storage of information special storage facilities would be required to maximize the lifetime of the media No medium lasts forever so transcription of information from old deteriorating media to new media would eventually be required however storage conditions can be optimized to preserve the current media copy of the information for as long as possible Information stored at room ambient conditions would be readily accessible and playable On the other hand information stored in deep archive conditions would require a period of time to acclimate to the conditions of the facility in which the information would be played back As such the storage condition recommendations are generally referred to as access storage and archive or preservation storage Key Feature Access Storage Archival Storage Function To provide storage for media that allows immediate access and playback To provide storage that preserves the media for as long as possible Acclimation required prior to playback No Yes Media Life Expectancy At least 10 years when stored at the indicated temperature and humidity conditions The maximum allowed for the particular media type Temperature set point At or near room ambient In the range 60 to 74F 15 to 23C Significantly lower than room ambient As low as 40F5C Humidity set point At or near room ambient In the range 25 to 55RH Significantly lower than room ambient As low as 20RH Temperature variations Difference between maximum and minimum value should not exceed 7F 4C Difference between maximum and minimum value should not exceed 7F 4C Humidity variations Difference between maximum and minimum value should not exceed 20RH Difference between maximum and minimum value should not exceed 10RH Table 2 Key Features of Access and Archival Storage of Magnetic Tape Information represents a general summary of conditions being proposed in drafts of storage recommendations by SMPTE ANSI AES and others Access storage conditions are recommended for those materials that need immediate access for playback purposes and for information that has a functional lifetime of ten years or less Access storage conditions are close to the temperature and humidity conditions of the playback facility generally room ambient conditions The single onesizefitsall storage condition recommended for magnetic tape in the 1980s and early 1990s generally fit the category of access storage Archival storage conditions are recommended for materials that need to be preserved as long as possible The conditions are specifically designed to reduce the rate of media deterioration through a lowering of the temperature and humidity content of the media The temperature and humidity are also tightly controlled to reduce the deformation of the tape pack as a result of thermal and hygroscopic expansioncontraction Considerable cost is normally involved in maintaining a temperaturehumidity controlled archive However as mentioned elsewhere in this report the quality of care a magnetic tape receives should be commensurate with the perceived value of the information contained on the tape If the information stored on the tape is of great value and must be preserved indefinitely this could justify the cost of purchasing and maintaining the recommended archive facility See Section 41 Tape Costs and Longevity for more information Removal of Magnetic Tapes from Archival Storage Tapes cannot be immediately removed from archival storage conditions and played on a recorder Time must be allowed for the tapes to equilibrate to the temperature and humidity of the recorder environment prior to playback This allows the stresses in the pack to equalize and the track shapes helical scan to return to normal In the case of very low temperature storage it may be necessary to place the tapes in an intermediate storage environment first to prevent condensation of moisture on the tapes and reduce stresses on the tape pack that would be introduced by rapid temperature changes In general it is the width of the tape that determines how rapidly it will come to equilibrium A tape that is twice as wide will take four times as long to stabilize to the new environment Table 3 indicates the amount of time that should be allowed for the tapes to come to equilibrium after significant changes in temperature andor humidity Heat and Moisture Diffusion in Magnetic Tape Packs IEEE Transactions on Magnetics 30 2 March 1994 237 Tape Format Time for Temperature Acclimation Time for Humidity Compact

Acclimation Times for Magnetic Media Removed from Archival Storage A tape that is stored at a temperature or humidity that is significantly below that of room ambient conditions must be allowed to acclimatize prior to playback 53 Refreshing of Tapes In order to maximize their useful life tapes may require periodic refreshing This is a nonstandard term in the tape recording trade that can refer to the retensioning or rerecording of the tape depending on the community of tape users To avoid confusion the terms retensioning and rerecording are preferred to refreshing Retensioning is normally recommended where prolonged tape pack stresses could cause damage to the tape Some manufacturers have recommended that tapes be unspooled and rewound at regular intervals often three years to redistribute tape stress and prevent tape pack slip cinching and tape backing deformation For example retensioning was often recommended for large diameter tape reels such as the old twelveinch quadruplex videotape reels so that tape stresses near the hub of the reel could be relieved Some tape user communities refer to the process of retensioning as exercising the tape Rerecording requires that data be read from and written to the same tape periodically to refresh the magnetic signal and prevent data loss Rerecording was employed primarily with some older ninetrack computer tapes used in the 1960s and 1970s that were susceptible to print through Transcription the copying of one tape to another has also been referred to as refreshing Transcription is the preferred term for this process Tapes purchased today generally utilize small diameter tape reels and high coercivity magnetic pigments so that they often do not require retensioning or rerecording on a periodic basis In some specific instances tape manufacturers may still recommend the periodic retensioning of tape see Ampex Guide in the Appendix for example It is best to check with the manufacturer to determine if tape retensioning is necessary Finally refreshing should not be confused with restoration Refreshing is a preventative maintenance procedure Restoration refers to the reconditioning of a damaged or degraded tape in order to allow playback Restoration is a repair or damage recovery procedure Appendix APPENDIX 1 Ampex Guide to the Care and Handling of Magnetic Tape The Ampex Recording Media Corporation a US magnetic tape manufacturer has developed many informational and training materials about magnetic tape The Guide to the Care and Handling of Magnetic Tape is reproduced here with the permission of the Ampex Recording Media Corporation Additions changes and comments by NML are shown in square brackets Some of the sections of this document deal with recorder aspects that may be beyond your control such as wind speed and tension if you are using a simple VHS cassette or reeltoreel audio deck However these sections still contain useful information on what to look for as signs that the tape is damaged or needs to be copied All sections of the original document are included for completeness but not all sections may be appropriate for your particular tape collection Recommended practices Tape should be handled only in no smoking no food clean areas Do not let tape or leader ends trail on the floor Do not drop or subject to sudden shock Keep tape away from magnetic fields Dont stack tapes on top of equipment Tape storage areas should be cool and dry Never leave open reel or cassette tapes exposed to the sun Avoid subjecting tapes to rapid temperature changes If storage and operating area temperatures differ by more than 15 F 8 C allow an acclimatization time within the operating area of four hours for every 18 F 10 C difference Store open reel and cassette tapes with the reels or tape packs vertical Reels should be supported by the hub Tapes should be stored like books on a library shelf on end They should not be stored laying flat Use high quality reels or cassettes boxescontainers and accessories Return tapes to their containers when they are not in use Cut off damaged tape or leadertrailer ends from open reel tapes For openreel tapes use protecting collars if available Do not use general purpose adhesive tapes to secure the tape end or for splicing If necessary use adhesive products designed for the purpose Minimize tape handling Do not touch the tape surface or the edge of the tape pack unless absolutely necessary and then wear lintfree gloves Clean the recorder tape path thoroughly at the recommended intervals Discard tapes with scratches or any other surface damage which causes significant debris to be left in the recorder tape path Ensure tapes to be reused are thoroughly bulkerased before they are put back into service Cleanliness Cleanliness is important because minute debris can cause loss of reproduced signal by disturbing the intimate contact necessary between the tape surface and the reproducing head Figure 9 shows typical dimensions of common contaminants in the context of significant tape to head separation A separation less than 110th of the diameter of a smoke particle will cause a 12 dB loss reducing the signal to 14 of the proper amplitude Figure 9 aposassetsimagesreportspub54figure9gifapos relativeurl Figure 9 Tape Debris Source Ampex Reprinted with Permission For analogue recording especially audio recording the effects of dirt and debris are much less important than for high density digital recording and video recording Relatively severe dropouts will be unnoticed in analogue hifi reproduction and even worse dropouts will not impair the intelligibility of speech Dropouts are much more important in instrumentation data recording and any form of high density digital recording If the signal losses are sufficiently severe to overwhelm the error correction data errors may result In video recording very short duration dropouts appear as irritating flashes in the picture and in this case perhaps unusually the eye is more critical than the ear For any type of recording things are not as difficult as they appear because spacing due to debris is confined to only a small part of the track width but the message for tape care is clear However most physical tape damage occurs when tapes are being loaded on a recorder or during handling before or after loading It is therefore preferable that tapes be kept clean to avoid the need for special cleaning that involves extra handling and passage through additional mechanisms For general purpose tapes a class 10000 clean room environment less than 10000 05 mm particles per foot is a good aim High density digital recording may benefit from cleaner conditions The worst contaminants which should never arise are sticky residues from improper tape end fixing tabs or elsewhere Special end retaining tape or tabs have nonoozing clean pealing adhesive Stray Magnetism This is less of a problem than often thought Devices such as walkthrough metal detectors use small fields that have absolutely no effect Handheld detectors are best avoided as high local fields may be present Xrays have no effect on unrecorded or recorded tapes Similarly radiation from radar antennas can be disregarded unless the field strengths are sufficient to injure people Some detectors used to screen luggage in airports use powerful magnetic fields that may partially erase recorded information on tapes These devices are used in some European airports It is prudent to keep tape away from transformers heavy electrical machinery and other very strong magnets Magnetizing forces of the order of 500 Am and above can cause partial erasure andor increase print through in the case of recorded tape Such fields may put low frequency LF noise on unrecorded tape This can be removed by bulkerasure The risk of increased print through applies to alternating fields that can act as a bias encouraging layertolayer printing Magnetic field problems are very rare even for tapes shipped internationally without special precautions The best protection for shipping is a minimum of 50 mm 2 inches of nonmagnetic material all round The inverse square law ensures that the fields from even heavy electrical equipment will not affect tape at 50 mm 2 inch distance Metallic boxes and foils offer no useful protection against stray fields but may help exclude adverse environments Tape Handling ",

Administrative Systemsltbrgt Yale University Libraryltbrgt June 1994ltbrgt Executive summary omitted Introduction During 1993 Yale University Library set up and evaluated the components of an inhouse production conversion facility converted and indexed 100 volumes in a test run and is now poised to begin the conversion from preservation microfilm of the next 3000 volumes of a projected 10000 volume digital library In the first phase of the projectthe organizational phaseYale conducted a formal bid process and selected Xerox Corporation to serve as its principal partner in Project Open Book During the second phase of the projectthe setup phaseYale acquired a single integrated conversion workstation through Xerox including microfilm scanning hardware and associated conversion and enhancement software tested and evaluated this workstation using prototype productionconversion and indexing software developed by Xerox and made the transition to a fully engineered production system The Commission on Preservation and Access provided support for the planning of Project Open Book as well as for the organizational and setup phases of the project The setup phase involved the indepth investigation of quality assurance and production workflow issues the initial development of selection guidelines for the identification of preserved materials appropriate for conversion and the formation of a preliminary plan for evaluating Project Open Book through significant input from Yaleaposs research community The setup phase also laid the administrative groundwork for fullscale production conversion which will take place in stages three and four With partial funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities the Yale Library is now prepared to select material for conversion from microfilm to digital imagery to install and manage a multiplatform networked conversion system and to implement a rich evaluation process over the remaining life of Project Open Book This report will outline the steps undertaken in the setup phase describe the results of our investigation into issues of project administration image quality and the management of highvolume productionconversion and summarize the projectaposs approach to selection and evaluation Background The June 1991 report entitled From Microfilm to Digital Imagery is the master plan for Project Open Book a major effort in the Yale University Library to explore the usefulness of digital technologies for preserving and improving access to deteriorating documents The project is founded on a vision of the research library as an institution whose mission is to generate preserve and improve for its clients ready accessboth intellectual and physicalto recorded knowledge The place of electronic tools and information sources in the library of the future will depend on how well or how poorly they measure up against this mission Digital image documents are among the various types of information that most likely will find a place in the accessoriented library committed to making available sources in electronic form Yaleaposs longstanding leadership in the preservation of paperbased library materials drives us to test the feasibility of using digital imaging as a preservation tool The purpose and scope of Project Open Book are designed to lead research libraries like Yale closer to a more general quotidealquot model of the role of digital image documents in the transforming library originally outlined in From Microfilm to Digital Imagery The model posits the existence of an image document library that is created from multiple sources and with multiple uses We imagine libraries will generate digital image documents from film and paper for preservation purposes as well as for more general reasons such as the creation of reserve materials or customized textbooks Libraries may also acquire image documents from external sources such as service bureaus hired to reformat preservation materials or directly from publishers or vendors After digital conversion libraries may opt to move the film and paper to remote storage Users may then print documents on demand from the image library browse them at a workstation or reformat them say by generating microfilm or by submitting them to character recognition processes The model posits that the quality of the image documents that libraries maintain will depend in large part on the expected mix of these various uses in both the long and the shortterm In Project Open Book Yale will convert 10000 volumes into digital image form This number is an order of magnitude larger than the number of documents originally converted in Cornell Universityaposs pioneering CLASS Project and our intention is to explore the effects of scale on emerging preservation imaging systems In addition rather than scanning directly from the original paper document the purpose of the Yale project is to convert material from frames of 35 millimeter microfilm to digital images and thus explore the promise that once we have preserved materials on film we can eventually and satisfactorily convert those documents into digital form Several other working hypotheses also help to define and limit the scope of Project Open Book including Microfilm is satisfactory as a longterm medium for preserving content even if it falls short as an access medium Digital imagery can improve access to recorded knowledge though printing and network distribution at a modest incremental cost over microfilm Researchers will demand greater access to digital image libraries if they contain thematicallyrelated materials than if image documents are randomly dispersed topically Capturing and storing documents in digital image form is a necessary step leading to even further improvements in access eg through the application of optical character recognition Taken together and verified in efforts like Project Open Book these various hypotheses may lead to the specific conclusion that research libraries will choose given a mix of flexible technology to maintain information on microfilm for longterm preservation and in digital image form for ease of access Regardless of its findings on the function of preservation microfilm Project Open Book promises to identify the institutional preconditions for the full integration of digital imaging technology into library preservation processes Yale completed the first phase of the projectthe organizational phasein 1992 As part of this phase Yale established a Steering Committee including several faculty members and created a project team The bulk of the organizational phase was devoted to a formal bid process which led to the selection of the Xerox Corporation as a principal partner and the identification of areas of risk and uncertainty and key issues to be addressed over the life of the project One benefit of the selection process was the involvement of a large number of Yale staff both from the library and computer center in the process of working with the competing vendors to develop their bids These staff contributed substantially to the analysis of the project requirements and gained knowledge and expertise in imaging systems A detailed summary of the organizational phase is contained in the report The Organizational Phase of Project Open Book The first phase confirmed that the management of complex documents in image form is a general problem crying for solution in many areas It is not confined to library preservation to libraries or even to academic institutions Although the market for imaging products is thus potentially broad our experience suggests that it is still maturing Development of the market will depend on many factors but in our view the adoption of digital imaging technology by libraries will depend on the successful resolution of several key issues in particular the quality of digital conversion from microfilm the costeffective production of image data and the indexing of image files to facilitate browsing These three issues along with the continuing need to identify and set selection criteria formed the heart of the setup phase just concluded Yaleaposs interactions with Xerox during the organizational phase generally validated the original master plan for Project Open Book The Setup Phase The overall goals of the second phase of Project Open Bookthe setup phasewere to assemble test and evaluate the basic operating elements of the imaging architecture for the project Installed components include a single conversion station built around an Intel 48633 platform running MSDOS and MS Windows 31 and a prerelease version of the digital library management software which was upgraded during the course of the setup phase to the commercially available product Xerox Documents on Demand In addition to the PC outfitted with a 19inch highresolution monochrome monitor the conversion workstation includes a Mekel M400 microfilm scanner a local device for writing digital data to 525 inch magnetooptical rewritable disks a Hewlett Packard LaserJet local printer for proofing newly scanned images a Xerox 4030 draft printer for hardcopy output from the Xerox software network access to a highvolume highresolution Xerox DocuTech printer and for bibliographic information about the documents in image form access to Orbis the Yale University Library online catalog An appendix outlines the components of the singleworkstation system installed at Yale during the setup phase The Mekel M400 scanner is controlled by Amitech Corporationaposs TurboScan software program It scans compresses and saves sequentially numbered image files at a maximum rate of one frame every three seconds A scanner options menu activates a number of image processing functions including automated document skew correction scaling cropping and rotation A date and time stamp are automatically assigned to each image file by DOS File names are controlled by the technician and a batch information file keeps track of the number type and location of associated files Typically each batch is one volume A digitally scanned raster image is essentially an electronic quotphotographquot of a document divided into a quotgridquot composed of thousands of minuscule picture elements or pixels each one representing a very small area on the original document Unlike alphanumeric data raster images consist of binary 1s and 0s that in themselves carry no intelligence and therefore cannot be queried in terms of what information the image represents At the point of scanning each pixel is registered with an average brightness called a grey level In order to reduce the amount of space and computer memory required to store and process full greyscale information each pixel is stored as being either black or white rather than as a grey level Scanners typically use a method called thresholding to convert the grey pixel to a black or white pixel The scanner compares the brightness of each pixel with a given threshold value If the pixel is brighter than the threshold value then the pixel is converted to white otherwise black The Mekel scanner is equipped with a special peripheral called the Scan Optimizer from Image Processing Technologies to improve the quality of this process with microfilm The Scan Optimizer looks for transitions between dark areas and light areas to define their edges This method works well with faded documents poor quality originals on film and other lowcontrast images where it is difficult or impossible to define a specific threshold between black and white The Scan Optimizer also permits the TurboScan software to define the beginning of a frame by recognizing the transition of the page from white clear to black on negative microfilm A handheld controller permits the technician to operate the Scan Optimizer interactively while scanning microfilm The controller is used to set the sensitivity level the amount of information captured thickness the relationship between lines and noise threshold levels equivalent to fine tuning after the thickness level has been established brightness levels which determine the extent of black fillin and filters which remove small speckle noise and thin broken lines The combination of these settings determines the extent to which overall conversion quality is maximized when quality is defined as a faithful reproduction of the original microfilm image The Scan Optimizer allows for the establishment of up to ten quotpresetsquot which store techniciandefined combinations of settings that can then be applied to a particular batch of images by way of the handheld controller In the course of converting 100 volumes from 35 millimeter preservation microfilm to digital image documents Yaleaposs project management team gained considerable expertise with the conversion equipment and the digital image software from Xerox and associated vendors The team experimented widely with Scan Optimizer settings and identified a group of quotpresetsquot that can be applied to microfilm images with varying characteristics Additionally the team identified the administrative quotpreconditionsquot necessary for successful implementation and achieved provisional definitions of the quality control structural indexing and workflow processes necessary for productionlevel conversion in subsequent phases of the projects The team also established the broad parameters governing selection of materials for conversion that will lead to the definition of a specific selection process and honed its understanding of the evaluation criteria for the project as a whole The following sections describe how Project Open Book has addressed each of these issues Preconditions for Project Implementation Planning in an environment of change requires close coordination and flexibility In the process of developing an implementation plan for Project Open Book the project team had to come to terms with three conditions that must be present in the library in order for the project to proceed A close working relationship with vendormanufacturers of hardware and software components is one crucial precondition Yale Universityaposs partnership arrangement with the Xerox Corporation which was forged in a complex bidding process during the first phase of the project provides a number of advantages for the library Among these are direct access to technology laboratories and research scientists for problem solving technical support and training on new equipment advance notice of new and emerging product lines and detailed information on corporate marketing strategies Yale has benefitted from its partnership with Xerox by being able to project with greater certainty the directions in which the imaging industry is developing and to plan accordingly The partnership arrangement with Xerox challenged Yale to balance its needs for the project with a corporation functioning within an increasingly competitive information technology industry Library administrators exercising the partnership option must be prepared for complex negotiations and development cycles that are driven more by corporate bottom lines than library project management requirements Another requirement for project implementation is the presence of skilled staff who understand the characteristics of the source media to be converted to digital images and are capable of mastering the capabilities of the newly acquired technology During the setup phase of the project a project team of existing library staff donated time for administrative support or were detailed temporarily from core duties to undertake conversion tests The availability of technical staff familiar with how preservation microfilm is created processed and used was essential to the successful completion of the phase It became readily apparent however that nearterm personnel needs could not be met with existing staff Moreover the existing technical job classification system at Yale has proven to be insufficient for the recruiting and training of qualified technicians to undertake the daily routine of digital imaging In anticipation of a longterm commitment to digital image conversion Yale is working to develop an entirely new job family of technicians and to hire project staff into this family at the appropriate skill levels needed for the project Matters of personnel administration can be significant barriers to the implementation of imaging projects if not managed proactively Finally successful project implementation depends upon administrative support and leadership During the organizational phase of the project the vendor selection process allowed Yale to involve a large number of staff both from the library and the computer center and particularly during the development of the projectaposs requirements to cultivate their knowledge and expertise In the setup phase of Project Open Book the wide involvement of staff and faculty continued in the form of special demonstrations and briefings consultation on technical processes and wide ranging discussions on selection criteria and evaluation strategies The project is now a central component of the libraryaposs vision of its emerging support for electronic research resources and is a continuing focus for fund raising and outreach to the library community The burgeoning interest in the conversion of library materials to digital images is but one part of a larger transformation of library services Relationships among publishers libraries and patrons are being fundamentally redefined in the face of information technology and it is the responsibility of library administrators to manage this transformation Quality Digital Conversion One of the central questions addressed through Project Open Book is quotWhat is the highest possible quality of microfilm conversion that can be accomplished within the limitations of existing technologyquot Defining quality in the imaging environment is not a straightforward matter In the absence of computerassisted image calibration that automatically sets filters and enhancement parameters to achieve maximum data conversion the standard of acceptable quality in the imaging environment has been the judgment of experienced system operators Even the effective use of calibration tools developed by the Association for Information and Image Management AIIM for example ultimately depends on how any particular test target image appears on the screen Conversion from microfilm to digital imagery entails establishing procedures that mitigate the inevitable threeway interaction among the characteristics of the original source materials included on the microfilm the technical characteristics of preservation microfilm itself and the capabilities and limitations of the hardwaresoftware conversion system The setup phase of Project Open Book demonstrated that achieving quality conversion in a productionconversion environment even when quality is rigorously defined entails some measure of compromise between the capabilities of the conversion system and the demands of efficient production It is essential that project administrators maintain thorough documentation including logs of benchmarking runs and equipment tests on the nature of the choices made to limit conversion quality in the interests of costeffectiveness The setup phase of Project Open Book identified the major characteristics of original source materials that when reformatted on preservation microfilm complicate the productionconversion process Library materials be they books journals manuscripts maps or photographs present significant challenges for digital image conversion Unlike office documents library materials vary greatly in size contrast color and condition Cornell Universityaposs CLASS project as well as other ongoing pilot imaging projects demonstrate the capability of imaging technology to achieve nearfacsimile reproduction of paperbased materials Obtaining the highest quality conversion of library materials in a production environment however requires that compromises be made in overall quality The following are among the most significant characteristics of the original source document that affect conversion from microfilm Tone and physical condition of paper Books with yellowed andor brittle edges dogeared pages and uneven foreedges tend to confuse the edge detection software equipped with the scanner If the threshold level is set low enough to compensate for page edges that are not crisply defined other discrepancies in the film such as splices between frames may cause the software to malfunction The size clarity and contrast of the typeface are significant variables in the scanning process The presence of illustrations such as line drawings engravings and halftones may require special scanner settings which may impact the readability of accompanying text In determining filter settings a decision must be made about the intellectual significance of the illustrations in terms of the text and adjustments made accordingly Foldouts such as maps and illustrations that must be reproduced across the entire 35 millimeter frame will inevitably slow digital conversion as settings must be adjusted to accommodate fullframe imaging and then reset to resume the conversion of individual pages Many colors do not reproduce well on highcontrast preservation microfilm If color is integral to the understanding of the content as is the case for maps binary digital image conversion black and white most likely will not be appropriate The characteristics of document images reproduced on preservation microfilm have a tremendous impact on the quality of the resulting conversion as well as on the rate at which that conversion can take place Preservation microfilm is by nature a highcontrast medium for reproduction First generation film used as the master negative and to create second generation copies is panchromatic extremely fine grain silvergelatin type document recording film Secondgeneration film used for the production of positive use copies and also used by Project Open Book for digital image conversion is nonreversing negative silvergelatin nonperforated polyesterbased duplicating film The RLG Preservation Microfilming Handbook specifies separate film stocks for materials with standard black on white text and for materials containing halftones or continuous tone illustrations The following are the most significant film characteristics Resolution is the ability of the microfilming system camera lens and film to record fine detail Resolution is measured on microfilm by viewing the reproduced test target containing test patterns arranged in groups of horizontal and vertical lines of specific size and spacing The RLG handbook which describes and interprets the relevant ANSIAIIM standards specifies that a good quality microfilm system should be able to register 120 line pairs per millimeter on duplicate negative film The findings of the setup phase of Project Open Book reinforce the need to examine closely the methodology for interpreting resolution when microreproduced test targets are converted to digital image AIIM has recommended the use of resolution indicators on the IEEE Std 167A1987 facsimile test chart for calibrating digital image scanners Density refers to the opacity of the film On master and duplicate negative film the maximum densityor background densityis the dark part of the image whereas the minimum densityor base plus fogis the clear part of the film on which there is no image The actual background density of the negative is in part determined by the contrast of the original materials The RLG handbook specifies that the maximum density of film containing high contrast originals fall within the range of 10 to 13 Overall microfilm should not have maximum densities below 080 Project Open Book has validated these density recommendations with the additional proviso that consistent average density readings within a single volume is a far more significant determinant of image conversion quality than any particular average density value within the range of 10 to 13 Reduction ratio is intimately related to the quality of conversion because the ratio determines the amount of visual data stored on the microfilm that is available for digital conversion Library materials reproduced on microfilm are reduced to a specific ratio that may range from 81 to 141 The exact reduction ratio for a given volume is a crucial variable that the imaging system needs to reproduce faithfully the size of the original document Although the RLG handbook permits libraries to film materials either at fixed or variable reduction ratios variation of ratios within a volume will cause production delays Ultimately the quality of the digital image conversion is determined by the specific capabilities and limitations of the digital conversion hardware and software as they interact with the characteristics of the original source materials reproduced on preservation microfilm Among the most important of these capabilities in the Project Open Book conversion system are the following Any scanning device has a finite limit on the amount of data that can be captured about any given surface area By necessity this limit determines the top range of image quality The maximum capacity of the CCD array charge couple device of the Mekel scanner is 7042 pixels per inch ppi at 16 millimeters and 3694 ppi at the full 35 millimeter width The conversion of microfilm at 600 dpi is actually a process of adjusting the capacity of the CCD array in relation to the reduction ratio of the materials preserved on film Sixhundred dpi resolution therefore is actually a softwarecontrolled mathematical artifact of the scanning processThe Mekel scanner and its associated software addons equip the technician with a variety of filters and threshold settings that determine the nature of the data conversion process Inadequate documentation on obtaining high quality results however requires quottrial and errorquot processing to understand the interaction of the filters and system settingsIn its present configuration the Mekel scanner converts each frame of microfilm with a uniform set of filter settings The scanner does not have the capability of creating a combined digital image with one set of filters for text and another set of filters for quotwindowquot containing an illustration on the same physical page The lack of a quotwindowingquot capability means that the technician must make choices in the process of conversion about which type of image content text or illustrations to emphasize The ANSIAIIM standard on monitoring microfilm scanner image quality recognizes the technical limitations of current conversion technology and identifies three principles of image quality control The standard designed expressly to support the conversion of business documents recommends establishing quality references defining quotgood outputquot from a digital image system conducting scanner testing before and after converting each batch of microfilm and maintaining thorough records of testing and calibration Of these three the concept of quotquality referencequot has proven to be the most challenging for the production team during the setup phase precisely because the existing standard presents a circular argument for identifying quality conversion quotIf the quality of the digitized test target images is of appropriate quality emphasis added this becomes the aposquality standardaposquot The standard calls for scanning a suite of test targets printing out the results on paper and then carefully examining them without defining a quality benchmark The standard cautions against the exclusive use of the screen for examination of a test run output The setup phase of Project Open Book utilized two discrete approaches to benchmarking as a way of transcending the limitations of the scanning quality standard To establish the capabilities of the scanning system the project team produced three test rolls of preservation microfilm identical in all respects except for the average density readings Reel 1 was exposed near the bottom end of the acceptable density range for preservation microfilm 90 reel 2 was exposed near the top of the range 14 reel 3 was exposed in the midrange of the average density guideline 11 A variety of standard test targets were filmed at the beginning and end of each reel including AIIM X491 Test target No 1 AIIM X492 Test target No 2 and the RIT Process Ink Gamut Chart Each reel also contained roughly 90 exposures from books serials archival records and various illustrative materials representing the array of images likely to be encountered in Yaleaposs existing collection of preservation microfilm Following exposure all three test reels were developed carefully according to the most stringent archival processing standards Duplicate negatives of each master negative reel served as the test rolls The major advantage to the project in creating test reels was the possibility of controlling for the huge variation in the visual characteristics of original source materials as well as controlling for subtle variations in the chemical processing of archival microfilm over time In order to establish the range of useful system image capture and enhancement presets the project team developed a second benchmarking system which will be used selectively in the production conversion phase of the project In essence the planned approach seeks to control for the capabilities of various display devices CRT screens and laser printers The fundamental assumption of this benchmarking process is that visual comparison of hardcopy output from the microfilm imaging system should be made neither against original printed source materials nor against a display screen but rather against digital images of the original source materials Furthermore the approach assumes that 100 percent benchmarking of all converted materials is not necessary for establishing a viable quality control system The following is a summary of the image benchmarking process planned but not fully implemented in the setup phase Choose a sample of hardcopy originals along with print negative counterparts Digitize portions of the original volume at 600 dpi title page table of contents selected illustrations indexes using a calibrated Xerox WG40 flatbed scanner with as many of the enhancement features invoked as possible and practical and following the operational guidelines developed by Cornell University Produce laser prints at 600 dpi on the Xerox DocuTech Digitize the identical pages from the microfilm print negative version Produce laser prints at 600 dpi on the Xerox DocuTech Compare matching prints under an eyeloupe 10X magnification paying particular attention to letter fillin or dropout or fill in highlights and shadows in line drawings etc Choose one combination of filter settings for the microfilm scanner that achieves most closely the appearance of the digitized original Note the characteristics of the film source once quotmaximumquot quality has been obtained Scan a volume with similar basic characteristics without benchmarking from the original Compare prints of quotbenchmarkedquot volume with unbenchmarked one adjust settings accordingly note sources of discrepancies for future reference If the major goal of a conversion system is to maximize quality in a production environment then it is essential to recognize that compromises will be necessary The next phase of the project will begin to generate systematic information to answer the following questions What is the nature of these compromises Are they acceptable to users to librarians and to the preservation community What are the advantages of the alternatives to the choices made for purposes of highspeed production What research and development needs to be undertaken to establish parameters for machineassisted quality control Benchmarking from original source materials may be an acceptable solution in a pilot project but in the real world of research library preservation microfilm may be the ONLY form in which the original source now exists We anticipate that the experience of converting 10000 volumes from microfilm with only minimal reference to the original hardcopy published version will provide the library community with significant practical information on image conversion and image enhancement Digital Document Indexing The project also seeks to address the question quotHow can digital imaging technology provide enhanced intellectual access effectively and efficientlyquot Intellectual access in the context of Project Open Book is defined simultaneously in two distinct senses First intellectual access is the suite of traditional practices of bibliographic control that organize books serials archives series and other recorded knowledge in standard ways such as title author place and date of publication and subject When sophisticated database management tools are linked to the capabilities of digital imaging systems intellectual access has a second meaning namely the set of tools and techniques that permits users to grasp and make use of the content structure of the material often represented through tables of contents lists of illustrations or tables and word indices to the full text of the material In providing direct and ready access quotinsidequot a published work transformed from the linear format of microfilm digital imaging technology holds great promise of effecting the usefulness and useability of preserved materials One challenge for Yale in Project Open Book is to identify efficient ways to use existing database technology and standards to develop structural indexes for large complex and varied published and sometimes unpublished source materials More pointedly the project needs to reconcile midnineteenth century publishing practices with late 20th century technology In its current singleplatform configuration the image conversion workstation provides for direct linkage to Yale Libraryaposs bibliographic database Orbis via a highspeed Ethernet connection Library patrons will utilize the public access mode of Orbis to search among those portions of Yaleaposs collections described online using the usual searching conventions such as Boolean logic operators to locate materials available in image format The user interface in its ideal configuration would permit seamless hyperlinkages between the Orbis searching engine and the image server allowing patrons to view image and index data for a title on a single access workstation without leaving the core program The master plan for Project Open Book describes the way bibliographic image and index data would display in a distributed computing environment Currently viewing of image files is only possible on dedicated access workstations although the project is proceeding as if the overall goal will be met by the end of Phase IV In the setup phase the production team established the mechanism for informing patrons of the existence of image formats and identified the procedures for establishing unique identification numbers for image files to provide the essential links between the image database and Orbis Xeroxaposs document management system is only used to log each itemaposs unique identifier as it appears in the Orbis system and to log brief author and short title information During the next phase reformatting technicians will modify the bibliographic record for converted titles to indicate that an image version of the book or serial is available for consultation using a standard phrase and noting the unique identifier of the image file Access to the content of an imaged document is provided by way of a separate relational database Using Xeroxaposs quotDocument Structure Editorquot software reformatting technicians apply page numbers establish hierarchical nesting of images and label the indexing levels as appropriate In a volume scheduled for conversion for example the technician might identify the title page and associated prefatory materials label the table of contents and other quotfinding aidsquot in the book including backofthebook indexes and lists of illustrations and indicate where each discrete chapter begins A patron can then go directly to any of these structures The structural information is contained in an RDO Raster Document Object file which is Xeroxaposs adaption of the proposed international Office Document Architecture ODA and Interchange Format An RDO file contains information about the structure of an image document as well as a file location pointer for each page image in that document Each page in the document is represented by a single TIFF Tagged Image Format File file A TIFF file contains the digital data from the scanned page along with a TIFF header which describes the characteristics of the image file including the formula used to compress the digital data A TIFF header is comparable in scope and function to the fixed field header in a MARC bibliographic record and is analogous to an envelope that addresses and describes the contents in a structured way Because the Xerox database system is partially proprietary however the structure of a complex image document such as a book is displayable to the patron only with the use of Xerox software During the setup phase the project team experimented with a number of approaches toward applying the document structure editor to a wide variety of midnineteenth and early twentieth century published materials This was a period during which authors and publishers themselves experimented with the structure of the books they produced Tables of contents varied widely in their placement and level of detail Similarly word indexes to the content of a particular work took many forms and served a variety of purposes not commonly seen today Special lists of illustrations glossaries of terms and other internal tools aided the reader in using a volume As the next phase of the project begins Yaleaposs production team will seek ways to apply the structural editor consistently while recognizing the intense inconsistency of the forms and formats of the materials being converted At the very minimum the actual page numbers of the volume will be applied and the images for a particular volume will be clustered under the title page which will display first to the reader when the document is retrieved If resources permit at least two intermediate quotlevelsquot of indexing will be applied The first of these will involve identifying and tagging each volumeaposs internal quotfinding aidsquot including tables of contents word indexes and special lists A second level will cluster pages in logical intellectual groups such as chapters subparts articles or issues based upon the specific structure of the work Our report on the next phase of the project will provide more detail on indexing structures utilized Conversion Workflow Management The operational core of Project Open Book is sustained productionconversion of microfilm frames to digital images The central workflow question of the setup phase was quotHow might quality image conversion and indexing be obtained in a production environmentquot The project team isolated and investigated a number of independent factors that have a major impact on the rate of conversion Among the most important of these factors are the technical limitations of the scanning hardware particularly the mechanics of winding and rewinding film on the scanner incomplete bibliographic records and technical targets that hinder the preparation stage the huge variation in the technical characteristics of preservation microfilm the complex structure of many published materials or the nearly complete absence of structure including page numbers for others weaknesses in the user interface that complicate quality assurance activities especially the complexities of the zoom feature and the control of default filter settings and slow data transmission speeds on the network and within the integrated software system During the next phase of the project we anticipate that the networked multiworkstation environment will produce an additional set of project management issues that will be described in subsequent reports During the setup phase the project team outlined in some detail the four stages of the conversion process and estimated the productivity rates of each of these stages The conversion of 35 millimeter microfilm frames to digital images in some ways mirrors the initial creation of preservation microfilm itself The Preparation Stage begins with the application of the content selection criteria and ends with the mounting of the film on the conversion hardware equipment The key preparation steps are producing a printout of the appropriate bibliographic record for the title marking the location of the first and final frames of each volume on the reel with removable silver tape cleaning the film of dust and inspecting the microfilm on a lighttable and noting a range of characteristics on the workform Among the most important characteristics of the filmed item that are noted on the workform are reduction ratio orientation contrast print type and size condition of original and the frequency of illustrations Five density readings are taken for each volume and noted on the form along with the average of these five readings Additionally any special instructions for the reformatting technicians are noted on the workform including obviously missing pages often indicated by special targets inserted in the film sequence gaps in the filming excessive splices and the actual page number of the last frame of the volume Finally a simple mockup of the first and last pair of pages for the item is sketched on the workform The silver tape and the mockup are required because the Mekel scanner is not equipped with a mechanism for viewing film that is mounted on the scanner Once the reel of microfilm has been mounted on the calibrated scanner the Scanning Stage can begin The key steps in the scanning process include creating a batch directory for the item with a unique file name establishing the scanning cropping parameters based upon a test scan selecting scanning options by entering the results of the film inspection from the workform and beginning scanning in a continuous mode At its maximum capture rate of 600 dotsperinch the Mekel scanner actually converts onehalf of each frame representing an individual page in a single pass through the length of the film At the end of the volume the technician rewinds the film to the beginning of the volume and resets the scanner so that the second half of the frame again representing a single page can be scanned This technical solution for maximizing the resolution of digital conversion requires that materials on the microfilm be oriented in a quottwoupquot cine mode as opposed to a comic mode The quottwoupquot orientation allows the scanner and associated software to separate two pages filmed as a single microfilm frame Even though the conversion software provides for the scanning of individual page images in comic mode the Mekel scanner can obtain a maximum resolution of only 300 dpi During the scanning stage the reformatting technician may rescan an unacceptable image at any time and overlay the newly converted image on the old The major reasons that rescanning may be necessary include the failure of the edgedetection software the presence of a particularly complex illustration a suddenly poor alignment of the original item on the film or skewing of the original in excess of 10 degrees The scanned quotbatchquot must be imported into the Xerox Documents on Demand software system from the TurboScan software associated with the microfilm scanner The Xerox software converts the batch of discrete image files into a single image document called a Raster Document Object or RDO that can be managed as a single object Once the scanned batch has been successfully imported the Indexing Stage may begin Yaleaposs report on the next phase of Project Open Book will included a more complete description of the indexing process During the indexing stage the technician has the best opportunity to undertake imagebyimage quality control including the generation of proofprints of selected images Unacceptable images can be rescanned immediately or flagged for rescanning at a later stage of the process The setup phase demonstrated that given the technical configuration of the system the most cost effective quality control takes place at the point of conversion rather than farther down the production line The final steps in the productionconversion process are those of the Quality Acceptance Stage in which the quality and completeness of the imaged and indexed document is confirmed and the data saved to optical disk The major steps in the stage include proofreading the accuracy of the structural index information and the pagination of the image document producing selective benchmark printouts to recheck the quality of the image conversion process rescanning of highly problematical images as necessary transferring image and index data to magnetooptical disk and the registering of the completed document in the Xerox Document Manager software During the registration step the technician enters the key descriptive attributes of the completed image document that will be required for searching and retrieval by users until seamless linkages are made with the Libraryaposs online catalog During the setup phase the project team developed and evaluated two possible workflow models and validated an equipment configuration that supported the teamaposs estimates of the best workflow model The team also compiled statistics on the rate of the overall conversion process concentrating especially on the time required to convert microfilm frames in quotcontinuousquot mode Based upon the experience of converting 100 volumes in a productionconversion mode we estimate that 60 minutes will be required to complete the conversion of a typical 300page volume from microfilm to digital imagery This hourlong process breaks down as follows 8 minutes for preparation activities including visual inspection density readings workform completion and preset selection 25 minutes for digital conversion 15 minutes for content indexing and 12 minutes for quality assurance Excluded from these estimates are a variety of document management activities that currently are quite time consuming and therefore will most likely be carried out in batch mode after hours These tasks include file transfer from magnetic to optical disk and file backup Selection for Conversion The setup phase defined the components of an issue that is critical to the overall success of Project Open Book namely a selection process grounded in specific selection criteria One of the four working hypotheses of the project is that scholars will find greater benefits from a cohesive concentrated and significant body of digital information In the abstract the question quotWhat is the virtual libraryquot is far too complex a matter to be addressed meaningfully in a single pilot project at a single research library A guiding principle of Project Open Book therefore is that the selection issue should be focused in operational terms on an existing corpus of preserved materials whose longterm value has already been determined and then further defined by identifying cohesive subsets of this corpus that can meet present teaching and scholarship needs of the university Finally the field of materials qualified for conversion will be narrowed by applying technical criteria designed to maximize the quality of the converted microfilm image and the productivity of the conversion process Existing Microfilm Yale will not create preservation microfilm specifically for Project Open Book The selection process is simplified for the project therefore because Yale will draw on the rich collection of microfilmed monographs and serials that it has created over a decade of largescale brittle book preservation projects funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities In general these collections include items from the period 1830 to 1950 that have already had significant curatorial review and been judged worthy of longterm preservation Among the microfilmed collections that will be tapped for digital conversion are the 25000 volume American History monographs collection the 22000 volume European History collection excluding the United Kingdom the 3200 volume French History collection and the 10000 volume History of Economics and Political Science collection This latter collection is part of an ongoing NEH project and another 10000 volumes will be filmed in the next year In addition to these large and intellectually cohesive collections Project Open Book has at its disposal some 5000 microfilmed volumes of highuse items that were preserved on demand from the entire corpus of humanities collections at Yale Content Usefulness First and foremost Project Open Book is a pilot research and development program within the Yale community As such ongoing evaluation by a subset of potential users of the image library is crucial to the success of the project The image library created in the project must be used relatively frequently in order for a systematic evaluation program to be implemented Content usefulness as a selection criterion therefore is defined as those clusters of materials from the overall microfilm pool with known relevance to the ongoing teaching and research program of Yaleaposs humanities scholars Furthermore the relevance of the collection must be tied to a commitment from university scholars and students to participate aggressively in the evaluation program Selection by content usefulness will not involve itembyitem decision making but instead will be a matter of identifying classification clusters from the Old Yale and Library of Congress schemes within large pools of preservation microfilm that hold promise of contributing to ongoing teaching and scholarship over the next two years Technical Characteristics Given the known technical limitations of the hardwaresoftware configuration a set of basic technical selection criteria must be applied to the microfilm collection on a titlebytitle or reelbyreel basis prior to acceptance for conversion Selection by technical characteristics of the input source allows for the convergence of maximum conversion quality at an optimum production rate The overall goal of the selection process is to be as inclusive as possible and to attempt to respond to any special technical challenges that arise during the course of routine conversion Any given volume will not be excluded capriciously for technical reasons Among the basic technical criteria that will be applied to each reel andor title that has passed through the quotcontentquot filter are Film Stock Input source will be 35 millimeter silver halide microfilm The duplicate negative 2N should be used for conversion Conversion from positive microfilm 3P is slower and of slightly lower quality because of image degradation in the copying process The master negative 1N should never be used for digital conversion given the risk of damage to the preservation copy Image Density The average density readings from the technical targets should be within the range specified in the RLG Preservation Microfilming Handbook for normal exposures 10 to 130 A minimum of two readings should be taken per title from the technical target with a preference for five readings from two separate technical targets for each title Additional readings from the body of the item itself should be obtained as needed to construct a full portrait of the volumeaposs density Orientation Original materials should be filmed quottwoupquot in cinemode with a limited number of fullframe exposures from any particular volume Random fullframe exposures eg foldout maps or illustrations require interrupting the continuous scanning mode of the equipment manually adjusting the settings and then resetting the software to resume continuous mode Reduction Ratio An accurate measure of the reduction ratio is crucial to the proper conversion of microfilmed materials The reduction ratio may either be obtained from the technical targets that precede the filmed item or from the bibliographic record In the absence of the reduction ratio figure noted at the time of filming the reduction ratio may be calculated by reference to the original item The time to recalculate the reduction ratio in this manner however may add substantially to the cost of converting the item Condition of Film Film stock should be relatively clean and free of scratches redox blemishing or major processing waterspots Additionally because film splices may result in scanner error the number of internal splices as opposed to splices between volumes should not exceed RLGaposs recommendation of six for the entire reel Additionally the setup phase has demonstrated that the quality and rate of digital image conversion are substantially improved when the following characteristics are present in the microfilm source Consistency of average density across the width of the reel across the length of the title and from titletotitle throughout the reel Image conversion proceeds more rapidly and more reliably the greater the consistency of microfilm image quality across the reel Clearly defined edges in the original source material filmed as measured by a rapid shift from black to white on the film The accuracy of pagebypage conversion depends in part on the implementation of edgedetection software If original materials were severely yellowed faded or discolored or if the edges were cracked chipped quotdogearedquot or otherwise not clearly defined the edgedetection software can be quotfooledquot Wide exposures complicate the system setup procedures and therefore increase the time required to convert the volume Frame exposures should not be set nearer than three millimeters from the edge of the film The gutter of a bound volume should be rigorously centered in the film aperture Avoid quotcreepquot of the center line of the material across the film which slows production as scanner settings are readjusted The alignment of materials should be quotsquarequot to the edge of the film Although software can quotdeskewquot a digital image tilted up to 10 degrees from square the process is very time consuming and therefore expensive Although the absence of one or all of these factors should not necessarily be grounds for exclusion from conversion it is important to recognize that the cost of working around the limitations implied by the absence of a consistent highquality input source whether microfilm or paper most likely will either substantially increase the cost of conversion due to the necessity to devote extra time and effort to quottweakingquot individual images or will substantially lower the overall quality of the converted images Project Evaluation Given the fundamental principle that the digital library created in Project Open Book must have value to contemporary users in the Yale Library we expect the selection of materials for conversion to proceed in tandem with the process of project evaluation The focus of the evaluation is on the useability of the system in enhancing access to preserved materials and the usefulness of the materials themselves for scholarship when converted to image form Our principal hypotheses is that digital image systems are at least as useful for research and at least as useable as their hard copy and microfilm counterparts for researching the same topic The clusters of issues to be investigated and systematic information to be gathered include the usefulness for research purposes of image content document structure indexes and linkages to the local online catalog compared to traditional access and browsing methods the usefulness and quality of the user interface screen displays and local printing capability as well as the need for these and additional tools and capabilities success in retrieving relevant information sources when the structure and overall content of the database is largely known and the characteristics of the user population especially its visual grasp of display screen layout familiarity with content of the image database and range of experience with online searching or the use of research resources in electronic form The project team with the help of the Steering Committee has begun to identify user groups in the Yale community who are willing to test the usefulness of the materials selected for conversion and the useability of the end product of the conversion process itself including the document structure editing and the user interface One such user group will consist of a faculty member and students enrolled in specific courses involving primary research in the humanities Material relevant to the class would have been digitized earlier in the project and the use of the digital library would be a required assignment for at least half of the class The second half of the class would be required to use materials on microfilm andor original bound formats Class members would provide feedback on the nature and quality of the imaging system and the research papers produced in the course could be evaluated for their use of imagebased as well as traditional library materials Such modified quotcontrolled field experimentsquot promise to provide valid and reliable assessments of both the useability of the system and the usefulness of the materials in the digital library for scholarly research Conclusion Yale University Library is now prepared to embark on the third phase of Project Open Bookthe productionconversion of 3000 volumes of the projected 10000 volume digital library In this phase Yale will identify the requirements for effective and economical digital conversion from microfilm images Given the optimal scanner settings and the workflow configuration as determined during the setup phase work in the third phase will validate the productionconversion model developed in the setup phase attempt to resolve any problems that arise from a threeworkstation environment and seek further to optimize productivity in the process The third phase will also examine the requirements for intellectual access to the digital library through the addition and use of electronic links between the scanned images and the standard apparatuspages tables of contents indices chapters and so onby which complex documents are typically organized This phase will systematically incorporate user access capabilities into the project Yale will add a viewaccess workstation in the library during this phase and will also introduce a network accessible document server with an optical disk jukebox The introduction of wider access to the digital library will enable Yale to execute its plans to evaluate user responses to the imaging system during this phase Yale must be able to understand and demonstrate its ability to provide the image document library as a secure and dependable network service During the next phase Yale will begin to develop such an ability The growing document library and the enhanced conversion storage and access subsystems achieved in the third phase of Project Open Book will create a solid foundation for multiple and concurrent networked access to the image library In the final phase of the projectthe networked distribution phaseYale will continue the highvolume effort begun earlier and provide access to the growing digital library over the campus network Formal evaluation of user responses will continue Yale will explore issues of network access and consider the costs and benefits of using service bureaus for digital conversion and document structure editing The deliberate phased approach of the project is a pivotal component of the overall strategy to achieve the critical objectives of the project At the completion of Project Open Book in 1996 the Yale Library with its vendor and university partners and with the support of its collaborators at other institutions will have thoroughly examined the means costs and benefits of converting large quantities of preserved library materials from microfilm to digital imagery Acknowledgements We wish to thank the Commission on Preservation and Access for its support of Project Open

by Donald K Sebera Consultant to the Commission on Preservation and Access Published by The Commission on Preservation and Access June 1994 This paper addresses research needs arising from the Commissions Preservation Science Initiativehttpwebarchiveorgweb19991007201904httpwwwclirorgprogramscpascience whose specific objective is to promote the development of communication among scientists and preservation administrators in order to solve problems of chemical properties of print media and set realistic priorities for continuing research The longrange objective of the initiative is to enable librarians and archivists to apply these skills to a broad range of scientific and technical challenges accompanying the new media Table of Contents Introduction The challenges faced by the preservation administrator of a research library or archive in choosing among preservation alternatives are daunting Typically faced with a varied collection and very limited budget an administrator must make decisions and allocate resources among alternatives ranging from preservation microfilming to engineering a preservation environment of controlled temperature and relative humidity Adding to the complexity and uncertainty of making these preservation decisions are nascent or nearfuture processes such as deacidification and paper strengthening as well as rapidly evolving technologies such as optical digital storage and format transfer that promise enhanced access Any means of quantifying the preservation outcome of employing even one of these approaches would provide a powerful tool for the development of an overall preservation strategy This paper describes one such quantitative toolthe isoperm methodthat quantifies the effect of the environmental factors of temperature T and percent relative humidity RH upon the anticipated useful life expectancy of paperbased collections This isoperm method provides ready answers to a large variety of questions related to environmental conditions such as How much longer can I expect my collection to be preserved if I follow the recommendations of my conservation staff to change from the present storage conditions of 73 degrees and 50 RH to 60 degrees F and 30 RH What are the preservation consequences of allowing wider swings in temperature and percent relative humidity about the established set point conditions since my HVAC heating ventilating and air conditioning consultant says tight limits are expensive in both capital and operating costs Should I cycle between summer and winter storage conditions if so what risks and advantages are entailed How can I convincingly show to curators directors and funding agencies the preservation gains expected to result from modification and improvement of existing or construction of new storage facilities The basic theory underlying the isoperm method has been described in detail elsewhere see Sebera in Readings and References This publication is intended to serve as an aid in understanding the concepts so they may be used with greater confidence My experience in presenting the isoperm concept has been that at first reading the science and mathematics appear complex and often intimidating I urge continuing on to the applications where all the difficulties will disappear Finally it should be noted that with appropriate modifications the method can be applied to other hygroscopic materials such as textiles parchment and so forth In fact it already has been extended to the preservation of film negatives IPI Storage Guide for Acetate Film Image Permanence Institute Rochester Institute of Technology 70 Lomb Memorial Drive Rochester NY 146235604 Scientific Basis Deterioration of paper occurs by a variety of mechanisms and paths one or more of which may predominate under specific circumstances In a truly comprehensive approach we must consider not only chemical deterioration but also biologicallyinduced degradation as well as physicallyinduced loss of strength resulting from handling and use at various frequencies and intensity The isoperm method is largely restricted to strength loss associated with the chemical reactions of cellulose hydrolysis and oxidation conventional wisdom ascribed 90 or more of deterioration of paper to these two mechanisms Basically the isoperm method arises from one idea the rate of deterioration of hygroscopic materials such as paper is influenced by the temperature and percent relative humidity of its surrounding environment The strength loss of paper resulting from the most common and important modes of chemicallyinduced degradation increases with increased temperature and moisture content Conversely lowering either or both temperature and moisture content of the paper reduces its rate of chemical deterioration and so increases the paper permanence The isoperm method combines and quantifies the preservation effects of the two environmental factors temperature and percent relative humidity and presents the results in a readily comprehensible and usable graphical form What is at first sometimes confusing but is essential to an understanding of isoperms is that relative rather than absolute rates of deterioration and paper permanence are employed That is if r1 and r2 are the absolute rates of deterioration of a specific paper under two sets of temperature and relative humidity conditions we shall not deal with r1 and r2 individually but only with their ratio r2r1 which measures the relative change in the deterioration rate resulting from the change in environmental conditions To illustrate suppose a certain decrease in temperature andor relative humidity results in the initial deterioration rate r1 dropping to a new lower rate r2 such that r2r105 This ratio carries the implication that all papers subjected to this change in environmental conditions will have their rates of deterioration cut in half The rate reduction would be the same twofold value irrespective if a paper was short or longlived A paper which for example reached a given state of embrittlement in 45 years under the initial set of conditions would because its rate of deterioration was halved attain the same state of brittleness in 90 years under the new conditions Similarly a paper with a 200 year life expectancy would see its permanence extended to 400 years It is the deterioration rate ratio that the preservation manager can control through changes in the temperature and percent relative humidity of the collection storage areas it is not possible to change nonenvironmental factors such as fiber type fiber length degree of heating of the pulp basis weight thickness and so forth all of which influence the absolute rate of deterioration of a given paper The time a paper takes to reach a given level of residual strength is of course inversely related to the rate of deterioration This life expectancy which we shall refer to as permanence rather than the deterioration rate is the more apt and useful term to describe the effect of environment The ratio of the two permanence values ie the relative permanence is mathematically the inverse of the deterioration rate ratio ErratumThe following formula corrects an error in the printed edition p21r1 P1 r2r1 r2 1 Here as in the earlier illustrations a precise definition of permanence has not been given it is only essential to understand that it denotes the time required to attain some specific state of deterioration or residual strength In other contexts it has been found useful to define permanence as the time required for a paper to drop to a strength of 1 MIT double fold at a 05 kg kilogram load but other measures may be used Effect of Relative Humidity Water is important as a reactant or catalyst in many chemical reactions As already stated the rate of deterioration of cellulose by hydrolysis is directly related to the moisture content of the paper which in turn is directly related to the percent relative humidity RH of the atmosphere in which the paper is placed We may summarize the effect of RH as the greater the RH of the environment the greater the moisture content of the paper the higher the moisture content of the paper the greater the hydrolysis deterioration rate of the paper the faster the paper deterioration the shorter the life expectancy permanence of the paper These ideas can be summarized mathematically in the equation r2 H2O concentration2 RH2 P1 r1 H2O concentration1 RH1 P2 2 where RH is the percent relative humidity of the environment in equilibrium with the paper1 Equation 2 provides a good quantitative approximation for deterioration rates and permanence in the practically important range of 3065 RH outside this range papers show increasing deviations from Equation 2 behavior Thus by controlling the relative humidity we can affect the paper permanence and within the middle of percent relative humidity values we can quantitatively estimate the effects with good accuracy Effect of Temperature It is widely recognized that most chemical reactions proceed at a faster rate as the temperature is increased Many of us are familiar with the rule of thumb stated in elementary chemistry courses that chemical reaction rates double with each 10 degrees C increase in temperature However in truth each reaction displays a different specific sensitivity to temperature changes increasing by more or less than the factor of 2 Physical chemists have developed a theory of chemical reaction rates Transition It is widely recognized that most chemical reactions

preservation applications3 Up to this point we have examined the effects of changing temperature and percent relative humidity individually in both qualitative and quantitative terms What remains is to combine their effects into a single equation that will be transformed into the graphical isoperm formulation Combined Effects of T and RH If changes in both T and RH are simultaneously made to a papers environment the resulting deterioration rate will reflect their combined effects This combined effect on the rate ratio is the product of the individual ratio effects Therefore by multiplying Equations 2 and 3 we get the overall effect on deterioration rates equiation 4 aposassetsimagesreportspub46equat4gifapos relativeurl Equation 4 equation 5 aposassetsimagesreportspub46equat5gifapos relativeurl Equation 5 Using the appropriate environmental values for the Ts and RHs and an estimated or experimentally determined value for delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl these equations can be evaluated algebraically to obtain a quantitative evaluation of permanence changes Definition of Isoperm Algebraic computations using Equation 5 would be time consuming if not daunting to all except those with mathematical interests and skills The equation would be more readily usable if cast in graphical form The next paragraph which describes this transformation is the key to the isoperm method Consider a paper at equilibrium with some initial conditions of temperature and relative humidity that determine its rate of deterioration and permanence Now let us increase the relative humidity to a higher value if the temperature is unchanged the rate of deterioration will increase However if we reduce the temperature by exactly the right amount the resulting temperature induced rate decrease will exactly compensate for the relative humidity induced increase so the overall deterioration rate and permanence is unchanged from that at the initial environmental conditions We can make another change in relative humidity or temperature and another temperature or relative humidity can be found that again will exactly compensate for the new relative humidity or temperature induced permanence change There is of course an infinite set of such paired T and RH conditions all associated with the same permanence value These paired values when plotted on a graph of T and RH as axes generate a line This line of constant permanence isopermanence is defined as an isoperm Figure 1 is such a graph Erratum In the following formulae the printed text contains an error The highest value on the YAxis of Figures 1 2 3 4 and 5 should read 110 F Erratum aposassetsimagesreportspub46fig11gifapos relativeurl Fig 1 Construction of an Isoperm Paper permanence value at 68 degrees and 50 RH is assigned a relative value of 100 Other temperature and relative humidity conditions which also have permanence value of 100 are plotted and joined to yield an Isoperm of value 100 Valules of permanence at 50 RH and various temperatures are shown A 68 degrees F temperature and 50 RH is arbitrarily selected as the initial or reference environmental state of permanence P1 Any other T and RH values could have been selected as a reference state but 68 degrees F50 RH is reasonably close to common storage conditions and so can serve as a useful basis or standard for comparison with other conditions The other paired points and thus the overall shape of the isoperm is established by computation from Equation 5 In the calculation a value of 35 Kcal is used for delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl 1 and the relative humidity is changed by 10 increments the temperature which keeps the permanence equal to that at 68 degrees F50 RH is calculated and the paired points are connected The resulting isoperm line is labelled 10 since it shows conditions where all P2s equal P1 as the relative permanence is unchanged P2p110 What does the isoperm value of 10 on the graph mean For now as a first illustration we can say that if a paper had a 45 or 90 or 300 year life expectancy at 68 degrees F50 RH it will have the same permanence 45 90 or 300 years at any environmental conditions along that lineat 72 degrees F30 RH or 66 degrees F62 RH for example Figure 1 also displays the temperature at 50 RH corresponding to permanence values greater and less than 68 degrees F50 RH The isoperm values of 50 and 033 at 54 degrees F and 78 degrees F respectively mean that the paper of 45 years permanence at 68 degrees F would require 225 years to attain the same state of deterioration at 54 degrees F but only 15 years to attain the same state of deterioration at 78 degrees F Figures 2 and 3 display a completed array of isoperms for delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl values of 25 and 35 Kcal drawn for selected relative permanence valuesOther isoperms can be calculated from Equation 5 or

insignificant for most practical purposes Applications of RH vs T Isoperm Diagrams We now have reached the point where we have all the elements necessary to utilize isoperm diagrams in answering questions like those posed in the Introduction The remainder of this paper will explore various scenarios to illustrate how RH vs T isoperm diagrams can assist in making preservation management decisions As a simple illustration consider the scenario A collection of relatively shortlived papers perhaps newsprint paper estimated to have a permanence of 45 years under 68 degrees F50 RH storage conditions must be moved to make room for a more valuable collection It is suggested that the papers be temporarily 12 years placed in storage in a utility tunnel The site chosen is next to a slowleaking steam line and the papers will be in an environment of 95 degrees F and 80 RH What are the preservation consequences of making this move Referring to Figure 2 we see that the 90 degrees F80 RH conditions lie between the 010 and 002 isoperm linewe can estimate a 003 isoperm value We conclude that under the new storage conditions the collections life expectancy would be reduced to about 3 of the permanence at the initial conditions that is about 16 months Even given the uncertainties inherent in the estimation4one or two years of this temporary storage would destroy the collection The preservation manager is now armed to reject the proposal and suggest an alternative Diagrams plotting RH vs T can be of value even in the absence of an isoperm application Very often discussions of preservation issues with nonspecialists are more effectively conducted through the use of graphs and other visual aids For example the area on Figure 4 labelled TOO INFLEXIBLE quickly communicates the idea that because papers stored at low relative humidities say less than 30 RH with their low attendant moisture content are whatever their strength so inflexible as to be prone to damage in handling The graph quickly communicates the idea that papers should never be exposed to the labelled area conditions Similarly high relative humidities are conducive to mold formation and foxing of paper The area labelled MOLD indicates environmental conditions to be avoided if these forms of biological deterioration are to be prevented5 Figure 5 shows an area labelled TOO RAPID DETERIORATION it expresses a specific management decision A policy decision has been made by the preservation manager or director or even at the board of trustees level that no item in the collection should ever whether in storage exhibition shipping on loan and so forth be exposed to environmental conditions at which it will deteriorate at a rate say three times greater than that of the institutionapos Figure 4 aposassetsimagesreportspub46fig4gifapos relativeurl Fig 4 Percent relative humidity versus temperature Isoperm diagram displaying environmental conditions unsuitable for paper Relative humidities greater than 65 subject paper to hazards of mold growth and foxing values less than 20 RH reduce paper flexibility to potentially hazardous levels Figure 5 aposassetsimagesreportspub46fig5gifapos relativeurl Fig 5 Isoperm diagram displaying environmental conditions for which deterioration is so rapid that paper permanence is onequarter or less than conditions of 68 degrees F and 50 RH Also shown are relative permanence values associated with environmental conditions associated with human comfort normal storage conditions of 70 degrees F50 RH an isoperm value of 079 The preservation manager can construct an isoperm at the 026 value all exposure of objects to conditions to the right of 026 isoperm the labelled area are barred by the policy A RH vs T isoperm with the restricted areas indicated could be made part of any loan agreement between institutions Figure 5 also displays an area labelled HUMAN COMFORT ZONE HVAC engineers architects and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA have defined a range of temperature and relative humidity conditions that provide acceptable comfort and safety for humans working in or occupying a building6 Such a relatively wide range of conditions allows libraries and archives with good environmental control systems to select and maintain specific conditions within these limits The ultimate choice often is established by the director after consultation with HVAC engineers system operators perhaps an architect various staff members and union representatives The director will obtain information about capital and operating costs and maintenance expenses for various conditions there may be a history of complaints from public and staff about hot cold clammy and other conditions and the architect may indicate potential structural damage from excessively high percent relative humidity conditions What should the preservation managers contribution and recommendations include The earlier discussion of potential mold growth and damage from paper and book structure inflexibility clearly would be relevant but the choice made within the range of possible conditions can profoundly affect the preservation of the collection In Figure 5 the least favorable conditions are associated with the upper right hand corner at 76 degrees F60 RH this corresponds to an isoperm value of 033 The conditions most conducive to preservation are found in the lower left corner at 64 degrees F40 a 20 isoperm value The human comfort zone thus encompasses a sixfold range in collection permanence This relationship can be easily communicated to the director and advisors and used to support the recommendations of the preservation manager to establish low RH low T conditions Figure 6 displays what are by now fairly obvious applications of the RH vs T isoperm diagrams and one much less obvious application An arbitrarily selected point at 50 degrees F45 RH is shown surrounded by a dashed box This represents the preservation conditions with the environmental control system with 50 degrees F45 RH as its set point and 3 degrees F and 5 RH its control limits The isoperm running through the set point is 96 and the isoperms are 60 and 157 at the excursion limits of 53 degrees F50 RH and 47 degrees F40 RH respectively Thus the selection of these values for the set point and excursion limits results in a 1576026 factor in permanence Narrowing the excursion limits will reduce the range in permanenceundoubtedly at higher capital and operating costsbut extending the limits too widely will ultimately allow conditions of an excessively high deterioration rate The selection of set points and operating limits and their accompanying influence on costbenefits ratio is however somewhat more complicated than so far presented Looking at a RH vs T isoperm diagram we see that except at very low RHs the curves fall very steeply which implies deterioration rate is much more sensitive to T than to RH changes In the example chosen of 50 degrees F45 RH we can use Figure 5 or for greater accuracy Equation 5 to show the isoperm value changes by a factor of 113 ie 13 for each degree of temperature change but only by a factor of 102 or 2 for a one percentage point change in RH When the chemical deterioration factor is taken alone the preservation manager will probably decide to devote more resources to temperature control than to relative humidity control This judgment is supported by the observation made earlier that the moisture content of books responds more slowly to environmental changes than does the temperature of books Thus all but the outermost edges of a book would be at equilibrium with the longterm average relative humidity Figure 6 aposassetsimagesreportspub46fig6gifapos relativeurl Fig 6 Isoperm diagram displaying environmental set points and tolerance limits Set points are shown as set ranges are indicated by tolerance limits are indicated by surrounding broken lines Also shown are permanence consequences of annual cycling between winter 60 degrees F 30 RH and summer 80 degrees F 70 RH environmental conditions Figure 6 addresses a question posed in the Introduction suggesting that for economic andor operational reasons two set points should be established for the collection The first for winter months is of lower RH and T the second for summer months has a higher RH and T The three dashed lines connecting the two conditions represent the environmental path taken in transitioning between them Appropriate choices for the two conditions are anticipated to give a satisfactory intermediate average isoperm value that satisfies the preservation requirements However the preservation consequences of annual cycling need to be examined in considerable detail since cycling is more complex than it first appears Suppose the noncycling environment is taken as 68 degrees F50 RH and the unrealistically large but useful for illustrative purposes annual cycling is 8 degrees F and 20 RH The summer and winter conditions therefore are 76 degrees F70 RH and 60 degrees F30 RH These conditions have isoperm values estimated from the RH vs T isoperm diagram or more accurately calculated from Equation 5 of 029 and 43 respectively If for simplicity we assume that the collection spends six months in each environment ie the conditions are abruptly changed from winter to summer and the collection instantaneously equilibrates to the new conditions we can now ask the question how will a collection cycled over the 12month period fare compared with a constant 68 degrees F50 RH Our first observation is that summer conditions result in a deterioration rate 102935 times greater than the constant conditions while winter conditions yield a 431043 factor decrease in deterioration rate From this we might incorrectly conclude that apart from any potential cost savings cycling results in greater preservation of the collection This incorrect assessment is apparently reinforced by taking the average of the two isoperms 49029223 suggesting enhancement of permanence by a factor greater than 2 The key to a correct understanding of cycling effects is best seen by an automobile analogy Suppose a car is driven for two hours in two different ways the first for two hours at a constant speed of 50 mph the second one hour at 4 times the 50 mph speed and one hour at 14th the 50 mph speed How many miles how much paper deterioration occurs in the two scenarios In the constant speed case we have 2 x 50100 miles but in the second we have 1 x 4 x 50 1 x 14 x 502125 miles In a similar way the approximately 4x greater deterioration in the six summer months is not compensated by the six winter months of 14th rate of deterioration and in fact using our automobile analogy we may anticipate approximately twice the deterioration The summer and winter seasonal isoperm values of 029 and 43 may be used to calculate an annual average deterioration rate and a correct average isoperm value by recalling that relative deterioration is the inverse of relative permanence or isoperm value Thus the summer and winter deterioration rates are 102935 and 143023 giving an annual average deterioration rate of 35 023219 which in turn corresponds to a 11905 isoperm value Calculation of average isoperm values for other seasonal environmental conditions and time periods follows this same inverseinverse method of averaging This examination of cycling has much broader implications for the preservation of collections since it shows that any departure from moderate fixed to rapid deterioration conditions even for relatively brief periods of time results in more deterioration than might first be expected Recalling our earlier example even one short exposure of the collection to the hot damp leaking steam pipe environment greatly reduces its expected useful life Returning to Figure 6 allows us to develop a transitioning strategy between the two seasonal conditions that can to some extent mitigate these cycling effects Path A is like the example discussed except the transition takes place over a period of weeks or months with the RH and T each changed at a constant rate Path B also moves uniformly over time but in going from winter to summer and summer to winter conditions the rate of temperature change is varied so that for much of the year the collection remains in the high isoperm values thereby enhancing permanence In going from summer to winter conditions we lower the temperature as rapidly as possible and allow the relative humidity to catch up more slowly going from winter to summer is the reversewe keep the collection cold as long as possible then rapidly raise the temperature Path B is also the one most easily achieved in practice since as already noted book temperatures respond more rapidly to environmental changes than does book moisture content Path C is one which clearly results in more deterioration than A or B Figure 6 also displays a rectangular block surrounded by a dashed line box This rather like the depiction of a human comfort zone is the representation of the range of T and RH conditions specified as a standard A library can meet the standard by establishing a set point anywhere in the solid outlined box with the dashed line indicating the maximum T and RH departure allowed from the set point The preservation implications of a specific standard can be drawn by following the procedures already described One of the most difficult problems facing the preservation manager is the selection of set points operating ranges and cycling patterns for the collection environment especially where selections must be made from alternative and sometimes even conflicting standards The following scenario describes such a situation with an analysis that illustrates the role isoperms can play in understanding and quantifying various implicit preservation issues A group of expert conservators after considerable deliberation and using the available scientific information as well as their years of practical experience proposes the set of storage conditions displayed in Table 1 Several broad distinctions and categories were established Bound materials were distinguished from unbound a Preservation Collection was identified as distinct from the General Collection Distinct diurnal and annual environmental conditions were allowed as was specification of the rate of change between them Very low temperature storage conditions were specified presumably for special collections Alternative standards were proposed to allow costs and other practical considerations to be weighed in the ultimate choices and decisions The challenge to the preservation manager is to understand in detail what is being proposed and how to implement the appropriate standard A SET POINT RANGES GENERAL COLLECTION PRESERVATION

Environmental conditions illustrative of those proposed for storage of paper documents Even a few minutes spent examining Table 1 raises a number of questions and issues not easily addressed by the proposal itself How good are the various proposed standards for the General Collection How do they relate to one another in permanence value On what basis can we choose one over another The environmental conditions proposed for the Preservation Collection appear better but how much better Substantially Significantly Since the distinction between bound and unbound material probably expresses concerns about stresses by and on binding structure do the standards show differences that consistently reflect structural considerations Is it T or RH that the standards suggest impacts most on binding structures Can one even begin to estimate a costbenefit ratio for the alternative standards Are any of the standards compatible with comfort and safety requirements of staff and users The preservation manager undoubtedly can raise many more questions and issues to address before recommending a course of action Figure 7 displays the different standards proposed in Table 1 on a RH vs T isoperm diagram In the figure some of the relationships and the various proposed standards are immediately evident and answers to the previous questions clearly depicted Unbound materials can be kept at lower relative humidities although some standards propose identical ie in the diagram overlapping storage conditions The General Collection whether bound or unbound is stored under less favorable conditions than the Preservation Collection in fact one might ask if the conditions are adequate since the maximum bound General Collection isoperm has a 18 value On the other hand some Preservation Collection isoperm values are quite largestorage at 30 degrees F20 RH has a 150 isoperm value Under these conditions a paper with a lifetime of 75 years at 68 degrees F50 RH would be expected to survive for more than 10000 years Even more questionable perhaps is the standard proposing storage at 0 degrees F25 RH Here even an extremely shortlived paper of say 5 years would be expected from the isoperm value of 15000 to survive for 75 millennia Even allowing for major uncertainty in the isoperm value because of such extreme pressure on the assumptions and approximations in the isoperm method it is questionable whether such storage conditions can be economically justified and whether we know enough about sealed storage conditions and how they may promote deterioration Figure 7 aposassetsimagesreportspub46fig7gifapos relativeurl Fig 7 Isoperm diagram displaying set points and ranges illustrative of those proposed for paper document storage Table 1 The RH vs T isoperm diagrams do not of course make decisions but Figure 7 amply illustrates how they can by their convenience and quantitative aspects provide information to assist preservation managers in making decisions From the applications presented and scenarios considered it would be easy to presume that isoperm concepts are applicable only to institutions with large staffs and sophisticated HVAC systems In fact the isoperm method may be of even greater value where staffs are small such systems are lacking and environmental control is more difficult to achieve Examples may range from the very small locally supported historical society with some holdings of books letters and newspapers which is open only in the summer and is closed and unheated in the winter months to a medium size or even large library or public records office with adequate or perhaps excessive heating in the winter and open doors and windows in the summer In some cases a small staff may mean the director wears the preservation managers hat as well as many perhaps all others How can isoperms help in these cases Perhaps the greatest barrier to improvement in the preservation environment is the inability to assess the current preservation state and to ascertain whether and how changes can improve that state Knowledge of the preservation consequences gained from isoperm diagrams of making changes of only a few degrees in temperature can provide the additional motivation to make these and additional changes Undoubtedly the first step if it has not already been done is to measure temperature and percent relative humidity at various locations in the collections throughout the year If the T and RH data are plotted on an isoperm diagram even as they are being collected patterns of permanence values will develop Large pattern differences between summer and winter conditions certainly will appear There probably will be different patterns for significantly different areasnear windows when opened and closed near and remote from heating ducts areas in shade and direct sunlight south and west facing rooms compared with those facing east and north different floor levels and attic and basementare some general examples These plotted diagrams first of all provide a quantitative estimate of the current preservation status that may be compared against accepted standards There may be some pleasant as well as unpleasant surprises What actions can be taken to improve conditions is very situation specific but some possibilities are If it is found different rooms fall into different isoperm value regions it may be possible to shift temperature and relative humidity sensitive materials in the collection to rooms of greater isoperm value Experiments can be done changing the pattern of window opening and closing using awnings or sunlight shields or drawing in cool night air with small window or whole house fans The RH and T results of these experiments plotted on an isoperm diagram can measure how much if any improvement in conditions was achieved Use of the whole house fan at night or a small window type air conditioner while not causing drastic changes of environment may sufficiently reduce peak summer temperatures to produce as seen earlier in annual cycling a substantial preservation impact The condition survey isoperm diagrams together with diagrams showing the effects of changes already made and what remains to be done can be useful tools for obtaining additional support from local benefactors and foundations Quantitative knowledge of the preservation status of the collection can provide a powerful motivation for action Numerical Values of Isoperms It is appropriate at this point now that the isoperm concept and some of its applications are understood to examine in greater detail the factors which affect the numerical values of isoperms The values generated thus far arise from choices of parameters and assumptions which though useful for expository and illustrative purposes may not be best for a specific collection The following discussion illustrates how the isoperm assumptions and so Equations 4 and 5 and the resultant RH vs T isoperm diagrams can be modified to incorporate new experiential information In the development of Equation 4 the dependence of deterioration rate on RH was taken as linear and so the relative deterioration rate at two different RHs is also linear This is expressed mathematically in Equation 2 as raising the ratio of RHs to the first power Equation 2 aposassetsimagesreportspub46equat2agifapos relativeurl Some studies suggest that the deterioration rate is more sensitive to relative humidity than a linear dependence For some papers in the middle ranges of RH 3060 the dependence may be the power 14 rather than 10 thus the relative humidity component of Equation 5 would be the following aposassetsimagesreportspub46equatx1gifapos relativeurl The consequence of this change to the RH vs T isoperm diagram would be to somewhat decrease the steepness of the slope of each isoperm line We can estimate the magnitude of this effect at the RH limits likely to be encountered in a collection controlled by and HVAC system 3060 RH The relative humidity contribution to the isoperm value would become aposassetsimagesreportspub46equatx2gifapos relativeurl A change in value of this magnitude ie 30 while itself significant may not affect a management decision based upon life expectancy differences of 200300 or more More significant is the selection of an appropriate value of delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl As can be seen by comparing Figures 2 and 3 the difference between delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl aposs of 25 and 35 Kcal is substantial especially for large temperature changes The 35 Kcal value used in the examples was selected in part because it resulted in larger more easily recognized differences while still being a value appropriate to many papers The precise choice of a particular value delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl will unquestionably depend in considerable part upon the specific papers in the collection as well as the manner in which they are housed bound books boxed manuscripts newspapers and so forth For some of these collections at least a delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl value of 25 Kcal may be more appropriate and the RH vs T isoperm diagram of Figure 2 may be more appropriate than Figure 3The numerical values of isoperms discussed in the illustrations of stated paper should not be taken as necessarily the best for all situations The preservation manager before making decisions and committing expenditure of funds should seek the advice of experts or carefully review the most recent literature Indeed the need for more specific temperature dependency data has been recognized by the preservation community and proposals have been made to conduct such studies to obtain more information While awaiting these studies and expert advice the preservation manager can explore the preservation consequences using both the 25 and 35 Kcal isoperm diagrams Such a comparison will show the differences in isoperm value associated with this range of delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl values and suggest whether the differences are large enough to significantly affect the managers decision Another even more cautious and conservative approach would be to utilize the 35 Kcal RH vs T diagram for isoperm values below 10 and the 25 Kcal diagram for isoperm values above 10 This would have the effect of increasing exaggerating the anticipated harmful effects of higher temperatures and decreasing under estimating the life expectancy consequences of lowering temperatures Though such approximations may be sufficient to provide the basis for a management decision they cannot of course provide the confidence inspired by developing and using the isoperm values most appropriate to a given collection Summary This paper started with a brief review of the chemical and physical factors associated with the deterioration of paper It then combined them with several assumptions approximations and definitions to obtain an isoperma quantitative graphical measure of relative permanence Graphs were then used to describe and analyze a number of situations and systems The aim of the paper is to provide a language or device that aids understanding and communication of preservation issues and assists in making preservation management decisions Studies to refine the isoperm method by measuring delta h aposassetsimagesreportspub46deltahgifapos relativeurl values for larger numbers and types of paper are underway More detailed information about the relationship of relative humidity to moisture content and deterioration rate is being gathered as is information on the effects of relative humidity and temperature cycling The extension of the isoperm concept to other media such as magnetic tape textiles and film is being undertaken as mentioned earlier application to film already has been made by the Image Permanence Institute An earlier analysis of the effects of deacidification and paper strengthening upon paper permanence is also relevant Deacidification like environmental control fundamentally produces life extension by reducing the rate of chemical deterioration The analysis not only quantifies the consequences of deacidification but describes the powerful synergistic effects of combining different modes of reducing the deterioration rate for example a 3x reduction from environmental change combined with a 4x life extension from deacidification of acidic papers results in a 12x increase in permanence In a more speculative vein it appears that preservation and preservation management may be entering a stage of development when quantitative analysis techniques and models can be used to help make preservation management decisions We may be seeing the formation of a discipline or subdiscipline with the term Preservation Metricsrather like Econometrics in economics Isoperms may be one of the measures that will be found useful in

Selectionapproachestoselection Factors Affecting Choice of an Approachfactorsaffectingchoiceofanapproach On the Preservation of Books and Documents in Original Form Barclay Ogdenltbrgt October 1989 The national preservation program can save the contents of millions of brittle books through mass microfilming but many library materials with scholarly value as artifacts also are in need of preservation This paper provides an intellectual rationale for consideration of the book as an artifact and discusses possible selection strategies to provide a context for further exploration of these issues Introduction Some books and documents must be preserved in original form because they have scholarly value as objects as well as for the information they contain The challenge of preserving these materials called artifacts requires an understanding of the scholarly value of artifacts and the development of an effective and efficient strategy for their preservation Research libraries and archives collect information recorded on paper film and more recently analog or digital tape and disks all of which have finite life spans When the original paper film and other information media or formats deteriorate sufficiently to threaten loss of the information recorded on them a major preservation decision needs to be made If the information is to be preserved what is the most effective and economical preservation technology to use The decision can be difficult because no preservation technology is perfect some information is lost in order to save other information and decisions are made to save what is regarded at the time as information most likely to be of enduring scholarly value Libraries and archives are filled with examples of compromises made to preserve some information at the expense of information considered to be of less importance Microfilms and photocopies capture text but commonly lose much of the detail and tonal range of illustrations Repairs and restorations alter original books and documents no matter how carefully they are done Even library bindings change forever the appearance of books as published by replacing original sometimes illustrated covers with serviceable if unappealing buckram For books and documents whose scholarly value lies entirely in a reasonably faithful representation of text and illustrations the choice of an appropriate preservation technology can be made on the bases of technical fidelity of various reformatting technologies the kind of access needed to the preserved information and relative costs For many materials of scholarly value at risk of loss from deterioration microfilm is the preservation technology of choice because microfilm captures text well and the text is of greatest scholarly value For materials valued for detailed continuoustone or multicolored illustrations microfilm has not proven to be a good preservation technology Moreover materials made less useful by reformatting from paper to microfilm because the mode of access is less satisfactory are not considered good candidates for this preservation technology Even more challenging is the preservation of books and documents whose original formats have scholarly value as objects These materials have scholarly value that encompasses both the value of the text and illustrations and additionally an object or artifact value that is inseparable from the original format of the materials They cannot be microfilmed without loss of part of their scholarly value But exactly what are artifacts what is their importance to scholarship and how can artifacts be preserved effectively and economically Artifacts and Information Artifacts are often thought of in terms of rarity or uniqueness age and monetary worth Although these characteristics frequently are found in artifacts they do not of themselves determine scholarly value Many books and documents are old and rare but contain little scholarly value while some new documents may be of great importance Similarly the monetary value of some documents as collectors items has little relation to those documents importance to scholarship Most artifacts are valued primarily as evidence or proof of the accuracy of the information they contain Original documents are essential for many legal and scholarly purposes as proof of authenticity The authenticity of text even its legal credibility may depend on an analysis of the format Erasure marks impressed upon the surface of a handdrawn map warn that a location or boundary may have been falsified Pages tipped into already bound books sometimes suggest that parts of texts may have been changed Pastedon changes to a typescript distinguish an authors original words from those that found their way into print An original document is proof or evidence of how and sometimes when and where the document was made the type of paper with its watermark printing or writing ink the binding materials glues leather and cloth This evidence constitutes information about the history of the technologies involved in the manufacture of the document and often can help determine the date of an undated or inaccurately dated document Some artifacts are preserved because they are exceptionally fine examples of their technology or are artistic expressions Some manuscripts prints drawings and photographs made to record historical events were so finely done that they have acquired aesthetic value as well as value as historical documents Some bookbindings are not only exquisite examples of their craft but also are artistic expressions wrought in leather thus taking on the value of museum objects In all of the above examples the format itself has something to contribute to the understanding of the book or document Whether proof of authenticity evidence of manufacture or technological or artistic expression at least part of the scholarly value of the record is inseparable from its format Can a copy no matter how good of a book or document offer the same proof of authenticity as the book or document in original form The admissibility in court of copies of original documents grapples with part of this question How can a facsimile provide evidence of the original manufacture of a book or document Perhaps some forms of artistic expression would be less dependent upon original format if we had a preservation technology that could precisely duplicate the original and thus carry the same expression but to date there is no preservation technology with this capability When the original form or format contributes to the scholarly value of the record the record becomes an artifact Consequently the original format of an artifact cannot be destroyed without reducing the records scholarly value From the perspective of making a preservation decision should not we consider the original format to be information of scholarly value comparable to the words and illustrations more typically thought of as information By considering artifacts as information artifacts could be subjected to the same scholarly and technical review given to all records considered for preservation Books and documents valued exclusively for their contents currently are preserved only if that information is deemed to be of sufficient scholarly value to justify the cost of its preservation Analogously artifacts would be preserved only if their information is deemed of sufficient scholarly importance to merit preservation knowing that preserving these materials means preserving them in original format Though not the primary consideration of this paper in addition to artifacts there is a second category of books and documents that must be preserved in original format These are library materials whose information cannot be captured by the currently available reformatting technologies of microfilming or photocopying Art and art history archaeology architecture geology geography the life sciences and other subjects are heavily dependent upon illustrations that feature fine details continuous tone and color Moreover illustrated materials often are published in oversized formats with frequent foldouts All of these characteristics make demands beyond the capabilities of filming and photocopying Digitization is likely to overcome many of the limitations of current technologies but it is not yet available for preservation applications While they are not artifacts as described above many illustrated materials also must be preserved in original form until a suitable reformatting technology is available for their preservation With many materials and illustrated materials in particular satisfactory preservation solutions are further limited by requirements for access For example comparisons among illustrations in art history texts require consultation of several images simultaneously a difficult feat on a film or fiche reader Reference books need random access for quick lookups which are not at all suited to the sequential access of the microfilm format Thus the reformatting technology not only must capture all significant information but also must provide quality of access equal to that of the original format if it is to be fully satisfactory If all books and documents of significant scholarly value are to be preserved including artifacts and library materials for which a suitable preservation technology is not yet available we must extend our efforts to preserve some records in original format The information value of some formats in and of themselves limitations of current preservation technologies to capture all significant information and occasional special requirements for access indicate a need for a strategy for preservation of selected books and documents in original form A Strategy for Reservation in Original Format Traditionally libraries and archives independently have undertaken activities to preserve their collections by providing proper housing protection from fire and theft library binding and occasional repair and restoration Now libraries with custody of the nations research collections realize that a greater commitment of library resources is required to preserve their very large deteriorating collections The single but monumental problem of deterioration of library collections caused by embrittlement of paper alone has drawn considerable national attention along with additional Perhaps the least obvious and most commonly overlooked problem with the effectiveness of any preservation technology that reproduces or alters the original no matter how faithful the reproduction or unobtrusive the alteration is that the scholar is left with information less reliably accurate than that in the unaltered original format Consequently a preservation strategy for artifacts might include a guideline that no treatment should be undertaken unless the risk of damage from delay or inaction is judged to be the greater risk A preservation treatment must be appropriate and economical Its appropriateness is measured by its ability to capture all information of significance The scholar must be prepared to identify now what information is significant for current and future study in order to ensure that it is captured Can a scholar always tell a conservator which attributes of an artifact are significant and must be preserved The remote possibility of identifying all artifactual information that will in the future be significant about a book or document combined with the inherent compromises between information saved and information lost during the preservation treatment process appears to argue further for a preservation strategy to restrict extensive preservation treatment only to books and documents that have artifactual significance and that are in urgent need of treatment Some treatments used to preserve materials in their original formats are very expensive Full conservation or restoration including chemical treatment and repair done to minimize its visual intrusiveness can cost several hundred to more than a thousand dollars per book or document depending on extensiveness of treatment Relatively few artifacts can justify the costs of extensive preservation treatment but fortunately not all artifacts in need of preservation require extensive treatment Most artifact treatments undertaken in many institutional preservation programs are minor but are sufficient to enable the continued safe use of artifacts at a per item cost of less than fifty dollars The vast majority of all artifacts could be preserved without treatment and at low cost through preservation measures to reduce their rates of deterioration and wear thereby extending their lives and minimizing the number of artifacts in need of treatment at any one time Controlling the environment temperature relative humidity air impurities and light levels reduces the rate of deterioration protective enclosures mitigate the effects of a poor environment or housing arrangement and reduce wear sensible handling and use practices help preserve artifacts for many decades of continued research Soon chemical treatment mass deacidification will be available to reduce the rate of chemically caused deterioration These measures could be the major components of a strategy for artifact preservation with extensive treatment as a relatively minor component As with preservation of all library and archival materials a strategy for preservation of books and documents in original format needs to encompass a justification for resources methodologies for selection assuming fewer resources than needs and a range of preservation technologies able to match problems with solutions Certainly artifacts could be claimed to have scholarly value sufficient to justify significant resources for their preservation A preservation strategy could be crafted to meet the needs of both the most important artifacts and those most at risk But the success of the effort will depend upon the involvement of scholars and librarians not only in identifying books and documents that must be preserved in original format but in fully understanding the nature of the preservation problem to be solved and in developing a strategy for its solution Commission on Preservation and Accessltbrgt 1400 16th Street NW Suite

in 1986 to foster and support collaboration among libraries and allied organizations in order to ensure the preservation of the published and documentary record in all formats and to provide enhanced access to scholarly information lthrgt Librarians and scholars are vitally interested in developing strategies and establishing priorities for choosing which materials to preserve when not everything can be saved This report is intended to stimulate further thinking on the part of the community of scholars who must have a voice in selection strategies Introduction There are more library books and journals in need of preservation today than can possibly be saved before they crumble and disappear Accordingly we cannot afford to spend resources on the preservation of materials that are unimportant Choices must be made and made with the best available advice as to the future scholarly value of the information to be saved The problem of brittle books arises from the acidic paper on which most books and journals were printed from 1860 to 1920 and the temperature and humidity conditions under which these volumes have been stored About 30 million books in US Libraries are sooner or later doomed to turn brown brittle and unusable The problem is a national not a local one and only a concerted national effort has any hope of rescuing our cultural heritage Libraries must cooperate in lending their salvageable volumes to the task and the federal government is the only possible source of sufficient funding The result must therefore be a national collection accessible to all scholars Some Distinctions In this paper preservation is used to mean saving the content of a brittle book whether through a gross transformation such as microfilming its pages encoding its languages electronically or reprinting it Conserving or restoring the original item refers to attempts to save the physical artifact as well The choice of mode may depend upon the rarity uniqueness or special features eg illustrations typography of the item as well as upon the feasibility and cost of the technology employed For the greatest part of the problem microfilming appears currently to be the preferable mode of storage for preservation although replication in other media from the storage microfilm may be preferable for use Manuscripts and archives also cry out for preservation or conservation but present different problems than scholarly monographs and serials do The latter are better known defined and classified than archives are and constitute a somewhat more manageable problem because they are kept in wellordered fashion in large collections that offer better accessibility for purposes of preservation Printed works also serve a larger constituency than most archives do and their relative uniformity compared to archival materials makes them easier to process on a mass scale Finally the existing bibliographic network for printed works can be used advantageously in selecting items to be preserved and in minimizing duplication of effort among preservation projects In view of the urgency of the preservation task printed works seem the best place to begin Success in this area will pave the way for further support in others Disciplinary Differences The needs and objectives of preservation vary widely across the several fields of scholarship Literary and historical studies make much greater use of monographs diaries and memoirs than the physical and biological sciences where greater reliance is placed on journal articles and conference reports Correspondingly in those areas of scholarship that focus on the movement and transformation of ideas changes in the text of novels plays and poems and connections among the cultural products of different eras and different places there is often a demand for more extensive preservationof each of the variant editions of a text or each of several reproductions of a work of art Such studies of stylistic or substantive variation are concerned with the changes or differences themselves in a work or a genre that is nominally the same The need for multiple versions is not merely scholarly scrupulosity Furthermore in some subjects the preserved collection should knowingly include secondary inferior or popular material for scholars sometimes want to know everything that was being said about a subject even by tendentious or inaccurate writers Students of history in any area present a particular problem for a preservation strategy for their scholarly mills can grind any kind of written or pictorial matter into historical grain In principle there is no topic no place no people no event or sequence of events about which an historical account cannot be written While the most trivial and frivolous topics are ruled out by the canons of scholarship there is nonetheless a vast body of material whose preservation can be justified on the theory that someday someone will want to trace the historical changes in it or relate them to another body of material Given such amplitude of potential resources a strategy of selective sampling from some bodies of materialwar veterans memoirs for exampleis justified Such caveats do not necessarily apply to the product of historical analysis however for the accomplished history of any topic place sequence of events and so forth may be justified as a portion of the cultural record of the society in which it existed On the other hand in the disciplines that accumulate knowledge by discovery of new data and revision of established principles such as the physical and life sciences the opposite is generally true Working scientists are usually interested in the latest version of a book or the latest number of a journal Great effort goes into updating revising and keeping current Active investigators and teachers of science generally believe that most essential knowledge from the past is for their purposes adequately represented in text books handbooks and reference works The earlier and usually inaccurate or mistaken theories observations or inferences are discarded to the historian of science not cherished for their current usefulness It appears therefore that the preservation problem is most pressing in the arts and humanities and correspondingly for the reason cited the choices of what to preserve or conserve are the most difficult Approaches to Selection Ideally a selection strategy would invoke the most informed and prescient scholarly opinion about the future importance of each individual publication there is neither labor enough nor time to make such a titlebytitle approach feasible however even in a limited area as a group of classicists working collaboratively to preserve a mere 20000 volumes discovered some less finegrained strategy is necessary and a couple suggest themselves One is a great collections approach that begins with an evaluation of the relative strength of collections by classificationeg the research libraries group conspectus this inquiry produced a ranking of comprehensiveness of various libraries in specific subject areaseg american history philosophy linguistics medieval english literature collections identified as comprehensive could be microfilmed in their entirety indeed it could be persuasively argued that since such collections had been identified they should be the first to be filmed in their entireties for preservation it is often more efficient to preserve all the material in a particular category than to deliberate lengthily about the relative importance of specific titles The wisdom of a great collections approach is usually apparent to scholars once they have become familiar enough with the parameters of the preservation problem to appreciate the magnitude of effort required and the urgency of the task such consciousnessraising is essential furthermore to the success of the preservation initiative which cannot succeed without the understanding support of the academic community a distinct effort of a particular sort needs to be made in this connection scholars are ordinarily not familiar with the strength of library collections outside their own special fields and indeed may not be able to evaluate confidently the strength of collections outside their own universitys further many scholars have become accustomed to a titlebytitle approach through a lifetime of judicious discrimination among individual authors specific topics stringently defined periods and other punctuate features of their intellectual arenas of work they may initially resist what they perceive as a sweeping indiscriminateness of the great collections approach The scholarly community can be of great help in clarifying the requirements of research advising on which materials are of little or no use and which are essential for an academic discipline scholars can help to make the judgment as to whether to preserve all of the items in a particular category or to choose a representative sample when there is great homogeneity of content among separate itemseg memoirs of war veterans victorian moral philosophical tracts selfhelp books Another approach suitable for small segments of a scholarly field is the use of an existing scholarly bibliography that presumably identifies the most significant work in say british empiricist philosophy or indic philology during a particular era when materials are known to be at greatest risk of embrittlement alternatively an individual scholar or group of scholarly specialists can draw up lists of authors whose work is considered important A variation of this approach involves enlisting the aid of the highly specialized subsocieties that can be found in most scholarly fields for example more than a dozen specialized interest groups in philosophy cover a range of topics the leibniz society and the medieval and renaissance philosophical society for example members of such highly specialized groups can bring a particular perspective to bear upon a bibliography of the larger scholarly discipline and make judgments about its contentsor construct their own specialized lists In the latter approaches whatever the source of the bibliography or the category of material it constitutes simply the first step in selection and must be followed by bibliographic crosschecking eg through oclc or rlg records to determine whether a preserved version of the item either exists or is planned thirdly a cooperative source usually a university library must be located to lend the item for the preservation process It is important to inform scholars about the need for preservation as well as the constraints financial logistic and temporalthat surround the process and equally important to involve them in making decisions about preservation scholars understanding of the process that is developed for deciding what to preserve and its credibility are essential for overcoming resistance and for generating support this need is particularly acute in view of the apparent necessity to choose a preservation processmicrofilmingthat has a bad name in the academic community generally technically imperfect carelessly executed microfilming has made even more unwelcome a medium that is greatly disdained in comparison to the familiarity and convenience of the bound book a little direct experience handling the crumbling pages that can be found in any library however is a powerfully convincing argument in favor of preservation nowbut the path toward that goal needs to be explored and discovered collaboratively on the part of librarians and scholars in order to reach it Factors Affecting Choice of an Approach The urgency of preservation of the intellectual estate of the nation demands that the task be done expeditiously while its vastness requires that it be done economically Both of these dimensions urge that the strategies chosen be as simple and straightforward as possible manageable by a wide variety of libraries a broad spectrum of scholarship and a large assortment of materials In an ideal world unlimited resources and vast amounts of time would allow itembyitem selection on the part of scholars exquisitely careful bibliographic checking by librarians and restoration of the conserved as well as preserved work to the shelves of its lending institution In the real world all of these features must be compromised The issue of cost is crucial given the vast quantity of deteriorating paper in libraries and the cost of selection cannot be allowed to consume a disproportionate share of the total cost of preservation As noted above there are opportunities for economies in the logistics of preservation and there clearly are economies of scale Scholarly judgment is of the utmost importance in identifying important bodies of material but it may be wiser as well as more economic not to attempt itembyitem selection but to sweep all of the items in a particular categorycollection into the preservation process Similarly if the machinesearchable bibliographic networks of the country do not evidence the existence of a duplicate preserved item that may be signal enough to include the item in the preservation process even though we know that not all of the collections of all libraries are included in that database An important logistic issue concerns the willingness of libraries to collaborate by lending portions of their collection to a preservation process The evidence of willing cooperation is to date immense Yet there are signs that there may be resistance especially on the part of faculty to a collaboration that involves sacrifice of a volume or its nonreturn to the shelves of the university library While librarians may be ready to recognize that in order to retain scholarly content it is reasonable to destroy a physical object before it selfdestructs faculty sometimes mourn or even rage Such postures could have a distinct bearing upon selection for preservation The national program of preservation does not have a wellmarked road ahead to travel but the direction it must take is clear enough Enough atrisk literature has been identified to justify an immediately increased effort to preserve it and this effort will teach us much about the task We do not know exactly what to do stepbystep but we know what needs to be done enlarge the involvement of scholars and librarians in the process explain it to a generally sympathetic public and legislature and learn as we go how to do the job better For more information on selection for preservation and the Commission Scholarly Advisory Committees see Commission Newsletters No 4 September 1988 page

<h1 id="foreword" tabindex="-1">Foreword <a class="header-anchor" href="#foreword">#</a></h1>
<p>This report, the first to be commissioned jointly by the Commission on Preservation and Access and Council on Library Resources, informs and supports our digital library programs. Digital technology is central to both agendas, and the new affiliation between the Commission and Council enables such collaboration to investigate areas of common interest.</p>
<p>Each time librarians, or scholars, or technology experts meet–separately or together to discuss digital projects, someone invariably raises the question, “Are there any sorts of inventories of scanning projects?” There are,it seems, several incomplete lists or promises to start such lists, but no one could point to one authoritative source.</p>
<p>We concluded that a snapshot of scanning projects at a particular point in time might serve as a beginning for a more comprehensive, authoritative inventory to be maintained indefinitely into the future. To that end, we engaged a reliable and careful researcher to do as much as possible to collect information within a short time-frame and to provide a brief analysis of some of the questions and needs related to the development of an inventory tool. In discussions sparked by this report, we hope to determine ways to build on this snapshot to create an inventory that librarians, archivists, and scholars will turn to with confidence when seeking information about digital collections.</p>
<p>This report is shared as a way of stimulating discussion and soliciting further input on the potential usefulness, scope, and desired features of an online digital collections inventory. The Commission and Council welcome commends (in either paper or digital form) to Communication Program Officer Maxine Sitts, mksitts@cpa.org, fax (202) 939-3499.</p>

<p>The digital age creates new delivery and access alternatives for libraries, as well as new preservation challenges. In turn the expectations of library users are changing. As people discover information resources online at their computer workstations, they also want access to the contents of libraries in that same online environment.</p>
<p>Digital conversion projects help provide the content for an online digital library; in some cases, projects conducted according to sound preservation guidelines also serve to reformat deteriorating paper-based resources. The Council on Library Resources and the Commission on Preservation and Access undertook this project to learn more about the types of digital conversion efforts underway (or completed) in libraries and archives. The idea was to take a first cut at sketching the nature and extent of efforts to make traditional, retrospective collections available in digital form, rather than to produce a comprehensive inventory.</p>
<p>While there is much talk of virtual libraries, it is not easy to discern how much progress is really being made from exploratory projects to new modes of access. Furthermore, creating online collections involves more than conversion of resources from paper or film to digital format. For example, it is helpful to know what subjects and media have been converted in order to focus on complementary materials or fill in major gaps in the digital canon. Quality issues that affect the preservation of and long-term access to digitized resources, as well as efficacy of their use, also can be best addressed when institutions share information and project results.</p>
<p>This preliminary investigation, and its appendices, exemplify the paradoxical nature of the transition to a digital world. The findings argue strongly that the online tools now at our disposal–particularly the World Wide Web – can do a much better job than this printed report of providing information and multi-dimensional access to these kinds of resources. This report is intended to move us closer to that goal.</p>

<h1 id="context" tabindex="-1">Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#context">#</a></h1>
<p>The explosion in popularity of the Internet underscores the tremendous potential that now exists for rapid, networked sharing of information across the country and around the world. While tools such as World Wide Web and Netscape make the Internet readily accessible even to novice computer users, a major impediment to such a global network of linked information resources is the fact that most documents are not yet available in electronic form.</p>
<p>Cultural institutions and universities–as major collectors, organizers, preservers, and disseminators of information–represent one of the best sources of “content” for this emerging global information network. Increasingly, they are committing resources to making information contained in their collections as widely available as possible, capitalizing on the evolving electronic information infrastructure. To do this, they will undertake massive projects to convert portions of their retrospective collections, which exist in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>There has recently been a burst of activity, much of it experimental in nature, towards this end. However, several very large electronic conversion projects (and related initiatives) intended to test and shape the new information infrastructure are also getting underway. All of them presuppose an information system that has either the Internet, or a more robust successor, at its core. If successful, they will go a long way towards real implementation of the digital revolution that has been predicted for so long.</p>
<h1 id="cpa-clr-inventory" tabindex="-1">CPA/CLR Inventory <a class="header-anchor" href="#cpa-clr-inventory">#</a></h1>
<p>In July 1995 the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Council on Library Resources undertook a joint project to determine how much digitizing of library collections was planned, underway, or completed. The object of the survey was to show which collections/subjects were available for on line use, as well as to highlight where there was little or no conversion activity. In addition, the project was intended to gather sufficient data to ascertain whether an on line index or guide to digital conversion projects would be either useful or practical.</p>
<p>Because the time frame for the study was quite limited, it was impossible to be comprehensive. But time was not the only restriction. Given the rate at which projects are announced, launched (and sometimes tabled), a complete study would be seriously out of date before it left the desktop printer. In fact, a significant percentage of the projects cited in previous studies have yet to materialize.<a href="#fn1">1</a> Similarly, some that were successfully launched and held great promise (like the JANUS project at the Columbia University Law Libraries) were unsuccessful due to technical or financial problems. In addition, many of the digital collections that do exist are not widely available (via the Internet), either because of local technical limitations or copyright issues.</p>
<p>As for the survey’s methodology, it evolved as the exercise took shape along the way. It started with a brief questionnaire which was circulated via several listservs, as well as to a number of individuals who were known to be involved in various digital conversion activities. The questions were brief and to the point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of your [library or archive] collections have been scanned [or digitized]?</li>
<li>Did the project include the entire collection, or simply a portion of it? (If a portion, how much?)</li>
<li>Under what subject would you classify each of the scanned collections (or, perhaps more appropriately: can you categorize each of the scanned collections by subject)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The questionnaire yielded approximately 40 responses.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was a useful instrument, but as it turned out, the most productive data gathering resulted from following leads from one knowledgeable person to another, interspersed with World Wide Web expeditions on the Internet. As is frequently the case with most investigations in and of cyberspace, serendipity played a major role.</p>
<h1 id="the-data" tabindex="-1">The Data <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-data">#</a></h1>
<p>As expected, the investigations turned up a hodgepodge of responses. There are innumerable projects which feature pictorial images (e.g. photograph collections, maps, drawings of some sort, or museum collections); there are documentary text editing projects for individual personal papers; there are literary and historical text encoding projects (which for the most part feature SGML encoding); there are efforts to convert entire collections or to provide a critical mass of materials in a particular subject area; and there are a wide variety of experimental projects of one flavor or another. In addition to projects which convert print-based and/or photographic materials, there are a host of mixed-media projects, as well as projects focused on additional formats such as sound recordings, films, microfilm, motion picture film, etc. There are also a number of initiatives to make materials whose original format is electronic widely available via the Internet.</p>
<p>Many of these projects are clearly experimental in nature; experimentation is essential in these early stages of the development of an electronic information environment. A number of other projects seem to be undertaken because of a widespread feeling that it is important to have digital projects underway in order to be current with the trends; but even these help to increase the knowledge base in the library and academic community–something which is also extremely important to the transition. Taken altogether the inventory highlights clusters of initiatives and indicates that a critical mass of on line resources is evolving–although not yet with any apparent coherence or logic.</p>
<p>In the course of the survey, it was pointed out more than once that a clearer definition of what was meant by ‘scanned collections’ was needed to help the potential respondents understand what the inventory would and would not include. While the focus of the investigation was to compile an inventory of retrospective library and archive collections that have been (or will soon be) converted to electronic form for networked distribution, the actual situation in cyberspace is that there are no clear demarcations or obvious definitions for distinguishing types of electronic resources and tools. In fact, there are many different perceptions and working definitions of what actually constitutes a scanning, a digitization, and/or an electronic conversion project. If the survey is an accurate indicator, most people use these terms somewhat interchangeably to refer to a variety of initiatives that ultimately result in electronic availability of retrospective materials converted from other formats. The reason is that although the term ‘scanning’ usually refers to the capture of digital page images (also referred to as bitmapped or raster images), this form of digital capture is sometimes followed by optical character recognition (OCR) conversion to fully searchable text–which then might be encoded using SGML, HTML or some other markup language.</p>
<p>In fact, there are very few “scanning-only” projects, other than for pictorial types of images. Furthermore, it is obvious from this survey that no two projects are exactly alike. Technical decisions are governed by many factors: the available hardware, software, and expertise; the nature and formats of the materials themselves; the anticipated use; and the budget. That said, the conversion projects usually fall into one of these general technical categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital image projects that take an “electronic photograph” of pages, graphics, prints, photographic materials, maps, or whatever (with accompanying metadata for describing, structuring, and indexing the image database).<a href="#fn2">2</a></li>
<li>Digital imaging projects with additional text-searchable files generated from the images (these can be uncorrected text files used for indexing purposes).</li>
<li>Full-text conversion projects involving either keyboard entry or Optical Scanning Recognition (OCR);<a href="#fn3">3</a></li>
<li>Text encoding projects using SGML or HTML, or some other mark up language.<a href="#fn4">4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This survey report focuses primarily on the first two categories, both of which involve the “electronic photograph” capture method–often referred to as scanning. This method is used most often in the retrospective conversion of traditional source material, because it “can accurately render the information, layout, and presentation of original source documents.” The third and fourth categories produce electronic text–that is, data that can be manipulated for searching and indexing purposes.<a href="#fn5">5</a></p>
<p>While there is still considerable discussion in the field about which of these four options is appropriate–and when, the <strong>users</strong> of these electronic documents are beginning to speak up. They want to download and manipulate the text and images–not just look at a book page on a computer screen. Some projects are providing both a digital image and an electronic version of textual materials. However, the economic factors rear their ugly heads at this point, because fully searchable texts are far more expensive and time consuming to produce than bitmapped page image scans.<a href="#fn6">6</a></p>
<h1 id="finding-out-about-digitized-collections" tabindex="-1">Finding out about Digitized Collections <a class="header-anchor" href="#finding-out-about-digitized-collections">#</a></h1>
<p>In the course of this survey, its author encountered some very interesting Internet navigation aids and resources that relate to the second reason for this inventory: to assess the usefulness and/or practicality of developing some type of tool or database that includes information on the wide assortment of electronic conversion initiatives. Clearly, there is not yet a straightforward, logical mechanism for finding out what collections are available in electronic form (and where and how).<a href="#fn7">7</a> Further, there is very little ability to filter or assess the resources that are there–and they range from the ridiculous to the sublime. However, there are some promising models, as well as some effective Web-linked resources that could inform a decision about the usefulness or the essential characteristics of a database of scanning projects. Further study of these tools may be warranted.</p>
<p>Following the inventory list of digital conversion projects, this report includes brief descriptions of some promising “infrastructure” projects. Although they are not conversion projects <em>per se</em>, they are very closely related, in that they address some of the practical, technical, legal, economic and philosophical problems that currently impede efficient storing, retrieving, transmitting, and true sharing of the types of electronic resources the inventory describes. The report concludes with a “list of lists” which refers to other valuable sources of information that supplement the citations in this report.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions" tabindex="-1">Conclusions: <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusions">#</a></h1>
<p>This inventory is a work-in-progress. In its present iteration, it represents a cross section of the types of digital conversion projects planned, underway, or completed. Due to time limitations, it does not include journal projects or online exhibitions. For the most part, text-encoding initiatives, videodisk projects, CD- ROM publications, and documentary editing projects were considered out of scope. Except for documentary editing projects, these sources are well indexed in other on line tools, some of which are mentioned in the final section of this report, entitled “List of Lists.”<a href="#fn8">8</a></p>
<p>The results of the survey were difficult to organize in a logical framework for a printed publication. Although some group naturally together, most are distinct enough to defy easy categorization. The sheer number of projects; the wide variety in focus, subject matter, and formats; as well as the fact that the pertinent information is changing constantly, all argue for a managed, online finding tool of some sort.</p>
<p>In the future, if this inventory expands and evolves into an on line tool, it should include features that were beyond the scope of this project–especially information about access to and availability of the materials, as well as any copyright restrictions. Ideally the tool should link directly to the referenced project Web page or the materials themselves, as well as to other subject or format based tools which index (or link to) related materials. Input from other experts on a useful structure and content definition, as well as more (verified) meat on the inventory’s ‘bones,’ are needed if it is to become a useful information source–either a database or a Web site.</p>
<p>It is clear from this survey that momentum is building, and that in certain subject areas a “critical mass” of on line resources is beginning to accumulate. At the international level there are promising indications of large scale projects in Europe and elsewhere that will make other national literature and political documents much more accessible. At home, the Library of Congress’s National Digital Library Project–in combination with the goals of the complementary National Digital Library Federation–hold great promise as well. Undoubtedly, it is time for such major initiatives to build on the smaller grass roots experimentation that has already occurred. Taken together, these initiatives have the potential to dramatically increase and improve access to information, and perhaps even, preserve it over time.</p>

(Updated, December 1995)</p>
<p>For discussion purposes, and in an attempt to find coherence in what is still a very chaotic and fluid information environment, the survey results are grouped as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I. Very large projects featuring national literature, history, and/or politics</strong><br>
<strong>II. Examples of broad subject areas with significant activity</strong><br>
(e.g. law; literature, history, and culture; and science and technology)<br>
<strong>III. Examples of special, archival, and manuscript collections</strong><br>
<strong>IV. Infrastructure projects and “List of Lists”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, these categories are arbitrary. Several other groupings could have been made (and, in fact, were before settling on these). The important thing was to find a logical framework, arbitrary or not, to give a sense of the types and scale of activities that are increasingly available to scholars at all levels and in all fields.</p>
<p>In general, the focus is on the conversion of library collections. Occasionally, commercial projects are mentioned when their content features existing library collections. CD-ROM publications and videodisk projects were not included. Examples of other types of initiatives–e.g. electronic text and image database projects–are mentioned in a few instances, in order to highlight the range of activity underway. Projects are listed only once, even if they might logically fit under several headings.</p>
<p>The report concludes with a section that describes several significant projects aimed at defining and improving the existing infrastructure for on line access to information. It also mentions some noteworthy Websites that lead to digital collections online. The are intended to be illustrative of the hundreds of similar sources increasingly available on the Internet.</p>

<p>This is initially a five year project to make historical collections from the Library of Congress (and other major research libraries) available to a much broader audience, taking full advantage of the Internet capabilities and an increasingly “wired” general public. At its core, the Library’s contribution to the national digital library will consist of hundreds of Americana collections, mostly primary source materials about the founding of the United States, including photographs, sound recordings, printed materials, and motion pictures. At the end of the first five year period (1995-2000), 1 million items from the Library will be available online. The plan is that these materials will be complemented by 4 million items from other major research libraries around the country.</p>

<p>The ARTFL Database is one of the most ambitious and successful electronic text projects. In 1981 a cooperative project by the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique and the University of Chicago was launched: American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL). At present the database “consists of nearly 2000 texts, ranging from classic works of French literature to various kinds of non-fiction prose and technical writing. The eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries are equally represented, with a smaller selection of seventeenth-century texts, as well as some medieval and Renaissance texts.” Access to the database is offered through the PhiloLogic full-text retrieval system (to scholars and students of institutions affiliated with the ARTFL consortium).</p>

During the first phase, Cornell University will collaborate with the University of Michigan; additional partners may join the project in later phases. Initially, 10,000 monographs documenting the period from 1850-1877 will be selected, scanned, and made available online beyond traditional institutional boundaries. A principle reason for a project of this scale is to provide sufficient texts and resources in a coherent subject area to enable substantive evaluation of the potential impact that widely available, networked digital collections can have on research and teaching.</p>

<p>DIANA is an on line collection of human rights documents, from the University of Cincinnati and other collections (it honors Diana Vincent-Daviss, a recently deceased law librarian who was devoted to human rights issues). The concentration is on the core instruments of human rights with plans to expand to include primary and secondary materials at a later date. Current digitization is of the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and the Dumbarton Oaks papers of the 1940s. The initial focus is on legal materials, but the scope will eventually encompass other human rights literature. Bitmapped images are captured first; Intelligent Character Recognition (1CR) is used to obtain ASCII text, which is then marked up in SGML. Long term availability issues have driven many of the technical decisions (including the choice of TEI/SGML and ASCll).</p>

<h5>National Agricultural Library (NAL) Projects</h5>
<p>Early on the NAL embraced the concept of replacing its traditional collections with a digital one. To that end it has sponsored a host of digitization projects– many of them in collaboration with other research libraries housing complementary materials; and its staff has played a leadership role in standards development, training, and public awareness of the potential that online resources have to support research. Noteworthy are the NAL Text Digitizing Program and the NAL Photo Image Project. Digitizing projects underway as part of the text program include 100,000 pages of mostly unpublished research material on Food Irradiation and 6500 pages (155 titles) on AquacuIture, consisting of frequently requested reference materials. Approximately half of the 131 reel microfilm set of the Papers of George Washington Carver have been digitized as well (and the remaining reels await additional funding).</p>

<p>In December 1994, the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Research Libraries Group created this task force to investigate the means of ensuring “continued access indefinitely into the future of records stored in digital electronic form.” The task force included individuals drawn from industry, museums, archives and libraries, publishers, scholarly societies and government. They were charged with framing the problems that need to be resolved, defining the critical issues, recommending actions, and consider alternatives to technology refreshing. The draft report was submitted in the fall of 1995, and is available at: <a href="https://www.rlg.org/">http://www-rlg.stanford.edu/ArchTF/</a></p>

<p>In October 1994, the Andrew W. Mellon foundation provided funds for a 4-year project to develop and evaluate a fully integrated multimedia information system. The goal is to provide users with logical, cost-effective access to a broad array of information resources from their local workstations. The library will create a hierarchical linked catalog and menu system that guides users to and between different information resources (both local and remote). There are also plans to develop several image, sound and video databases that can be used through the catalog and menu system. Interactive multimedia tutorials will also be developed to assist users.</p>

<p>This project is exploring the terms and conditions for the educational use of museum digital content on campus networks. Fourteen museums and universities are collaborating to develop solutions to the technical, legal and administrative challenges raised as the teaching and practice of art and cultural history moves into the digital era. In the process, the project aims to develop a model site license, which will make it possible for students to gain access to museum content, without having to “pay per view.”. Approximately 8000 museum images with related textual information are being made available on the participating university campuses during this pilot project.</p>

Subject: List of Imaging Projects</p>
<p>Hello, during the last couple of days I have seen a number of messages to the group asking for a list of imaging projects in libraries. The most notable of which is RLMS Electronic Imaging Technologies Committee list that was handed out at ALA last month. I just went ahead and scanned in the list and OCR’ed it. It is appended to this mail. The list might have some errors due to limits of OCR technology. If you find an email address or phone number that does not work please send email directly to <code>somaiyas@vtls.com</code> and I will check the original and email you the correct information.</p>
<p>In addition to the RLMS list I am also appending a list of four other projects that I have been involved with personally.</p>
<p>This list contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>66 on-going projects from ALA RLMS EIT Committee survey list</li>
<li>16 planned projects from ALA RLMS EIT Committee survey list</li>
<li>4 other projects</li>
</ul>
<p>List size is approximately 34K.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Princeton University and VTLS Imaging Services have just finished a joint project to scan the libraries’ public union card catalog, containing 6.5 million 3×5 catalog cards, to create a database of digitized images. The database represents 1.75 million titles acquired and cataloged before 1980, predating Princeton’s library automation and online catalog. Initially, the image database will not be integrated with the libraries’ online catalog, but will work in conjunction with it.</p>
<p>The 6.5 million images represent the LARGEST IMAGE DATABASE created in a library. The system uses the VTLS ImageManager software for retrieval.</p>
<p>The project will preserve valuable information, permit network access from non-library locations, provide enhanced searching capabilities to the libraries collection, create more efficient tools for maintaining the catalog, and provide a relatively cost-effective and error-free alternative to standard retrospective conversion.</p>

Researchers can also use hypermedia links to annotate the records with explanations or to create new links to other images or related documents. The scanned database consists of materials from three core collections: aquaculture, food and nutrition, and agricultural trade and marketing. Part of the collection comes from NAL’s CDROM production, while the remainder was scanned from NAL’s print collection. NAL has also added digital audio recordings which are linked to images by hypermedia links to provide voice explanations to selected images that are not self-explanatory.</p>

<h3 id="author-s-brief-clearinghouse-of-image-databases" tabindex="-1">Author’s Brief Clearinghouse of Image Databases <a class="header-anchor" href="#author-s-brief-clearinghouse-of-image-databases">#</a></h3>
<h2 id="identification" tabindex="-1">Identification <a class="header-anchor" href="#identification">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse of Image Databases is an online directory of image databases housed on a gopher server at the University of Arizona Library. It was created in July 1994 by Stuart Glogofi, Assistant Dean for Library Information Systems at the University of Arizona, who continues to maintain it.</p>
<h2 id="audience" tabindex="-1">Audience <a class="header-anchor" href="#audience">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse’s intended audience was librarians and archivists who were either planning or developing databases containing digitized images from their collections. Since its inception, however, the Clearinghouse’s scope and purpose has been expanded to gather technical and descriptive information about imaging projects as information resources, regardless of where these projects are being developed. Within this broad purpose is the expectation that, if this information is presented in a relatively non-technical fashion, it will he highly useful to people in planning and developing imaging projects. It will help avoid duplication and lessen the learning curve by identifying others who have worked with a particular storage media or original material. Because image databases are a relatively new endeavor, there are many information professional, scientists, and teaching faculty are new to this technology. The audience for Clearinghouse information is perceived to be vast and international in scope</p>
<h2 id="context-1" tabindex="-1">Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#context-1">#</a></h2>
<p>The University of Arizona Library, like other large university libraries, has a mission to promote the dissemination of information. The Clearinghouse is one effort to address this need. In the past two years, the hardware, software, and telecommunications needed to create and distribute an image database has advanced to the degree that interest in image databases is becoming widespread. Technological developments have also raised new interest to create image databases for the preservation of rare and special collections.</p>
<p>At the time the Clearinghouse was created, it was hoped that it would prove to he a useful contribution. Although others have helped fine tune the data model and construct the WAIS index, the Clearinghouse is the result of the efforts of one individual. Crucial activities such as entering data, creating links, editorial functions, soliciting participation, and implementing new features continue to reside with this individual. This raises a continuing support issue: there is the risk that if this person leaves the University of Arizona Library, the Clearinghouse will not continue to be supported.</p>
<h2 id="content-and-scope" tabindex="-1">Content and Scope <a class="header-anchor" href="#content-and-scope">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse is multidisciplinary and international in scope, although all entries to date are in the English language. While its primary orientation is to list projects, these listings are supplemented with information on related publications, keys contacts, the project’s purpose, and comments from the person submitting the information.</p>
<p>Projects are not limited to a particular media. For example, if a project is submitted to the Clearinghouse and it does not fall within an exiting media directory, a new directory is created. (See Appendix A for a list of the media currently included.)</p>
<h2 id="editorial-policies-and-process" tabindex="-1">Editorial Policies and Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#editorial-policies-and-process">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse operates with an open invitation for submissions. Projects are submitted via electronic mail, preferably according to the format described in the Clearinghouse’s “How to Submit Projects.” Little editing is made to submissions. For the most part, the submission is fp’ed to a directory on the Library’s gopher server and cap files are created for the institutional name and project name listings. Submissions that neglect to enter complete information are still added to the Clearinghouse in the hope that even an abbreviated submission will be useful to someone. Like Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire, the Clearinghouse depends upons the kindness of strangers.</p>
<p>The format for submissions is specified in “How to Submit Projects” (See Appendix B). In addition, World Wide Web users will find a form on the library’s web server for submitting entries to the Clearinghouse.</p>
<p>To maximize the voluntary participation of databases developers in listing their projects, the data model use5l in the Clearinghouse focuses on collecting only the most critical, basic information. Data fileds may contain highly teclmical information, but field headers use terminology that will clearly he understood by developers with a variety of backgrounds and levels of expertise. Clearly, asking people to complete the data element form may deter some from submitting their projects.</p>
<h2 id="physical-access" tabindex="-1">Physical Access <a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-access">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse is available to anyone who has access to the Internet, regardless of the sophistication of their hardware and software. Users can access the Clearinghouse if they can execute a telnet or gopher command, or via a World Wide Web client.</p>
<p>At the time the Clearinghouse was conceived and implemented, gopher and telnet access was the best option. Since then, World Wide Web has exploded and access via lynx (for VT1OOftextonly access) and graphical Web browsers, such as Netscape, were added in the spring of 1995. (See Appendix C for access information.)</p>
<p>At the time this essay was drafted, the University’s Library Information Systems Team (LIST) was enhancing project displays via Web browsers. A PERL script was written that takes the ascii files retrieved from the gopher server and converts them to an html format when displayed in a Web browser. In addition, LIST is exploring a way to embed a hyperlink within project descriptions having a URL so users accessing the Clearinghouse via World Wide Web might connect to the actual image database listed in the Clearinghouse.</p>
<p>Clearly, a resource that is available in an electronic form must keep pace with technological change. Having the time and resources to continually upgrade a project like the Clearinghouse is a continuing challenge.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-access" tabindex="-1">Intellectual Access <a class="header-anchor" href="#intellectual-access">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse was constructed with the intention of presenting its information in an open, easily identifiable format. Each entry is listed alphabetically by institution name and again by institution name but this time sorted in a media–type directory.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1995, access to the Clearinghouse was added via the University of Arizona’s World Wide Web server. In addition, WMS keyword searching was added. This has enhanced finding information contained in the Clearinghouse’s project descriptions. With access available via World Wide Web, high-level access tools such as Netscape and Mosaic can be used. Persons with these clients can set bookmarks to facilitate navigating directly to the Clearinghouse directories.</p>
<p>The Clearinghouse does not use descriptors or a controlled vocabulary. No special training or academic education is necessary to makes submissions or to work proficiently with the database.</p>
<p>The data element resource identifiers offer the potential of building a separate database that would be easily searchable by standard database management software, such as MS Access, Paradox, or Quatro Pro. Such a database will only be useful if project descriptions provide nearly complete data element information. A fiiture issue regarding data elements pertains to the need to augment current fields to reflect changes new technologies may introduce. For instance, if watermarking becomes extremely important, it will be important to add a data element that collects this information.</p>
<p>Another issue related to the data elements concerns completeness. As mentioned earlier, a balance was struck between collecting enough information on a project without going overboard. The Clearinghouse focuses on showing cornmona1ities so users can easily identify the information they are seeking.</p>
<h2 id="management" tabindex="-1">Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#management">#</a></h2>
<p>The Clearinghouse largely relies on posting messages to selected listservs and newgroups inviting subscribers to submit information on their projects to the Clearinghouse. On occasion, an image database is found that looks appropriate for listing in the Clearinghouse and its developer is contacted.</p>
<p>The Clearinghouse is one of many directories with multiple files on the Library’s Gopher and Web servers. The information is backed up regularly to tape according to standard procedures.</p>

<p><code>From: Robin Mills &lt;rmills@law.lawlib.emory.edu&gt;   To: Multiple recipients of list &lt;rlgdcp-law3lyra.stanford.edu&gt;   Subject: Electronic Text Projects</code></p>
<p>Liz Kelly, Kathie Price, and I were to gather information on existing electronic text projects. We’ve pooled our own information and sought more on the listservs. Below is a summarized list of what we have discovered. If you wish, I will prepare a list with more details about each project for paper distribution. I’m sure this list isn’t comprehensive, but it does give us an idea of what’s going on out there. I don’t think we’ve missed any of the really large projects. There are many projects on the horizon; what’s difficult to determine is how many are reality. Anyway, for purposes of our discussion tomorrow, here are our findings. The list is divided into four categories: international materials, finding aids projects, other law-related projects, and other general projects:</p>

<p>1. See Appendix I for an earlier survey conducted by an American Library Association Committee.</p>
<p>2. There are further distinctions that can be made depending on whether the scanning needs to accommodate illustrations imbedded in the text.</p>
<p>3. At the risk of further complicating these distinctions, often times the full-text conversion projects involve a first step which creates a digital page image to use for either keyboarding or OCR (the digital images produced in the process may or may not be retained).</p>
<p>4. These encoding projects also involve prior scanning, keyboarding and/or OCR steps as well.</p>
<p>5. From private correspondence with Anne R. Kenney, November 1995.</p>
<p>6. Anne R. Kenney “Conversion of Traditional Source Materials into Digital Form,” an unpublished paper sponsored by the private <code>DISCUSSIONS</code>electronic mailing list of the Getty Art History Information Program, June 1995, p. 2 and telephone conversation with John Price-Wilkin of the University of Michigan on July 28, 1995.</p>
<p>7. The University of Arizona Clearinghouse of Image Databases represents a good start. The access by institution, cross-indexed by media, is very useful. Keyword searching is also supported. Unfortunately, the resource “dies” in the middle when you get to the actual citation–a typed form that is usually only partly filled out with the requisite information The creator of the Clearinghouse, Stuart Glogoff, plans in due course (time and budgets permitting) to add “hot links” to the home page of each institution sponsoring a project. That would lead the searcher to the latest information, and perhaps even the digitized materials themselves- To fulfill its potential, the Clearinghouse needs paid staff to verify entries, seek out new ones, and generally maintain the information Additional information on this very important resource is included in <a href="#app2">Appendix II</a>.</p>
<p>8. As for documentary editing projects (with online products)–such as many of the Presidential Papers–a separate inventory might be warranted. The methodology of this study did not pick them up readily, and a survey would need to be targeted more specifically to capture information about these important resources.</p>
<p>9.Kenney, p. 3.</p>
<p>10. See also <a href="#app3">Appendix III</a>, which includes an informal, unpublished survey of Law related digital projects conducted in the spring of 1995 by Robin Mills (Emory University Law Library), Kathie Price (NYU Law Library) and Liz Kelly (University of Pennsylvania Law Library). It also includes list of the members of the Consortium for Optical Imaging in Law Libraries.</p>
